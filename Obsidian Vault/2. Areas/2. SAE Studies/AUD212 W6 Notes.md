# LAB TASK ~ SAMPLE PACK UPDATE

## Where is your group at?

Definitely a bit behind to where I think we should be at ~ I was sick for a whole week last week. Plus haven't been as onto the actual work during the last couple of weeks.

Thought we are a bit behind, I do think we'll be fine to smash it out through out this week. 

* REMEMBER: The project is due next week *officially* on the `Tuesday 31/10/23`

## Successes / Challenges?

**Successes**
Some of the successful things for us this project would definitely have to do with the recording / audio asset accumilation process. This originally started out a bit rough (outlined in challenges) but we definitely turned it around. 

I was sick all of last week so we were a whole person down but the group still managed to get in and smadh through a whole bunch of work ~ recording some samples using the synths at SAE.

**Challenges**
We definitely ran into a bunch of challenges, especially right at the start ~ mainly to do with issue of Control Room C (room wasnt ready).
As well as this, I was sick all of last week so the guys were unfortunately forced to work with one less person.

I think another one of our major challenges has to be with the idea of what we're actually doing - seems like its a bit _undefined_ ~ probably from not fully outlining the Market Plan out properly prior

## Artwork Update?

I've managed to get Stable Diffusion working so from here on in, doing the artwork shouldn't be too much of an issue / struggle.

I've attached a couple of examples that S.D has given me already. This will be refined during this week ~ in conjunction with feedback we've recieved as well as trying to keep eveything on theme. 

- Feedback last update was that the font etc. wasn't really on-theme & was a bit goofy

## How close to finishing are you?

We're definitely abit off from finishing unfortunately but still within our means if we knuckle down and smash through it

- - -
## Demos of Sound Pack, Who? When?

Some demo ideas we could do are:

- Music demo track ~ have this on SoundCloud - linked DL button to our 'website'
- Short video with horror imagery ~ for ambience & foley for film projects
- Foley use examples with short animations or videos

- - -
## How will you market the pack?

Marketting of the sample pack will done through a coupe of different ways:

- Social Media Platforms
  1. Tiktok
  2. Instagram
  3. Facebook

- On & Around campus ~ Using posters and QR Codes (QR Codes have the link to the website with the Sample Pack)

## Project Todo List

**PROJECT ARTWORK**
- [x] Mass produce artwork assets ~ Stable Diffusion
- [x] Get some font assets from somewhere 
- [x] Edit everything together ~ Affinity Photo
  - [x] Add in a 'Vol 01' onto the artwork

- - -
### *Stable Diffusion Prompt*

`Generate a chilling and ominous album cover depicting a scene inspired by the following themes: 'Haunted Forest,' 'Abandoned Asylum,' and 'Eldritch Horrors.' The image should evoke a sense of terror and unease, utilizing dark and eerie colors to create a foreboding atmosphere. Ensure that the generated artwork is rich in detail, with intricate elements that hint at otherworldly entities and sinister shadows. Let the viewer feel as though they're stepping into a Lovecraftian nightmare, where the lines between reality and the supernatural are blurred. Embrace the macabre and the arcane, and make this album cover a visual representation of the horrors that lie just beyond our perception.`
