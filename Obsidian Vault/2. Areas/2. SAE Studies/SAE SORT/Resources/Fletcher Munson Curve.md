[Fletcher Munson Curve Explained](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/fletcher-munson-curve/) 

The Fletcher Munson Curve is a sometimes hard to grasp concept, but also a very crucial concept to understand if you’re to get better at mixing. 

The Fletcher Munson Curve is basically a graph that illustrates an interesting phenomenon of human hearing. When listening to music through your monitors or headphones, as the _actual_ loudness changes, the perceived loudness our brains hear will change at a different rate, depending on the frequency. 

## To Explain it Further
- ==**At _low_ listening levels**== - mid-range frequencies sound more prominent, while the low & high frequency ranges seem to fall into the background.
- ==**At _high_ listening levels**== - The lows and highs sound more prominent, while the mid range seems comparatively softer

Yet in reality, the overall tonal balance of the sound remains the same, no matter what the listening volume.
The Fletcher Munson Curve is just an illustration of the concept with specific visual data. For mixing specifically the graph doesn’t necessarily need to be referenced, the understanding of the graph is important.

## The Problem with this Phenomenon
Though this phenomenon can be peculiar, it also provides a pretty big issue. 
One of the most fundamental characteristics of a good mix is achieving a pleasant balance across the frequency range (depending on genre, etc). 
This goal becomes increasingly harder to achieve when we consider how the perceived balance of frequencies change depending on the volume.

## A Possible Solution
A good way of looking at it is this:
As a _music consumer_ when you’re listening to music at **Half Volume** you’re more than likely listening with: **Half your attention** and vice versa; listening at **Full Volume** is like listening at **Full Attention.**

- ==1/2 Volume = HALF Attention==
- ==FULL Volume = FULL Attention==

So when doing your mixing, you can go in with the ideal of mixing it to sound best when **Listening at Full Attention / Volume**

## Imagine the Scenario
You’re driving in the car, listening to the radio, turned down. You hear something that sparks your interest, you turn it up louder and louder, and the more you turn it up, the better it sounds, and when you really love a song, you crank it!

While on the opposite side of the spectrum, if we’ve mixed it with the other ideal, listening at low volume would sound nice at first, but turning it up louder and louder, would cause it to sound harsher and harsher!
