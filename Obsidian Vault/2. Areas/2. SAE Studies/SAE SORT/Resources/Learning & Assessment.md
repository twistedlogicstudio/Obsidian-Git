# Unit Approach
The unit uses an activity based approach, where youâ€™ll apply the ideas, concepts, and research learned each week to different projects each module. Youâ€™ll be given a grade at the end of the unit based off of your performance and participation in the projects, weekly activities and with feedback sessions. This grade is based on the way you work (transferable skills) the process you use in completing projects and their final outcomes.

# How is Class Structured 
Whether your class is held on campus or remotely there are activities to be done **before, during & after** class.
Engaging in these activities will help you work toward completing your projects and ultimately determine your success in the module.

| Before Class                                  | During Class                                                 | After Class                                                  |

# Holistic Assessment
Your final grade is a holistic appraisal of your individual performance throughout the unit. Your individual performance will be assessed holistically by your facilitator for the duration of the unit in two ways:
- To gain a pass â€“ you must demonstrate that you have independently met the unit learning outcomes at a pass standard, through participation in pre-class tasks, in-class projects, and activities, and post-class reflection.
- To gain a grade higher than a pass â€“ you must demonstrate that you have addressed holistic assessment standards.
  Refer to the SAE Student Handbook for more information

# Project Feedback
Feedback comes in many forms and from all different sources, including your facilitator, your peers, examples of other work, as well as your own work & research. Itâ€™ll give you guidance on your progress and your potential areas to improve. Take note of your feedback because not only will it aid you in your growth, but youâ€™ll also be expected to reflect on your response.

## Project Progress
Your facilitator will provide you with feedback about how youâ€™re progressing with your projects. Each project will have a brief document that outlines the project and its requirements. Projects will include a deadline & milestones

## Feedback & Project Status
Refer to the Project Brief and submit a link to your Learning Journal and relevant documents as per the requirements. Once done the facilitator will give you feedback and indicate the status of your project and wether or not if its met the requirements.
