Mounting the microphone closer / further from the Talent will affect the frequency response & quality of the recorded audio

Mount it on the sternum - Maintains good balance of Freq. Response / Proximity / Access

Turning the microphone in the opposite direction can help with plosives, though practise with different shields, foams, etc.
