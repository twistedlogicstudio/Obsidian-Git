# Recording Location Sound for Film

### Audio Technology
When making a film, there’s so many moving parts and things to consider that sometimes thing slip under the radar, audio often being one of them. To save yourself some headaches in Post Production, heres some tips to get the most our of your Locational Recording.

## Plan Ahead
When locations have been found, it’s good practise to actively & critically think, plan and listen to the sounds happening around it the environment.
Ask questions like: 
- ”Are there planes flying overhead?”
- ”Roadworks nearby?”
- ”Noises at particular times of the day in this location?”

Questions like this will help you in planning the best possible time (& place) for the shoot.

## Dialogue is King
“Whatever you do, ensure your dialogue is recorded as cleanly as possible,” Chris says.
Dialogue needs to be an absolute priority wherever you may be recording, this is because its a bit of a rarity to reshoot a scene later just for dialogue, and while you can bring actors into the studio and do overdubs (aka ADR) it isn’t exactly cheap; actors often arn’t as practised in it either, all up this can end up being a nightmare trying to organise times and availibility, let alone laying down a good recording.

Another important point to think about, is if you’re working on a documentary, you realistically only get 1 chance to nail everything. You can’t expect non-actors to give it another go around, and while there are plugins and software to clean up audio (background noise, etc.) it isn’t always perfect, and can still alter the human voice quite noticeably.

Best way to do it, is to just get it clean on the day.

## Microphone Placement
Getting a clean recording is highly dependant on Microphone Placement. Remember that there’s **noise floor.** The closer the mic is to the subject, the cleaner it’ll be, because on the other hand, the further the mic is from the subject, the more background noise you’ll record. Keeping this ‘signal-to-noise ratio’ high towards your subject is important.

## Effects & Ambience
Some SFX like clothes rustling or dripping taps can be good to record on location, just be sure to keep these seperate to the dialogue. This is especially important if there scenes where the actors are walking and talking. 

Don’t forget that at the end of the day, story is most important. As stated before, think about the background sounds and how they’re going to affect the final mix, in regards to the story thats being told. 
*For Example:*
Maybe you’ve recorded dialogue during the day, but you’re now tasked with making it apear as if the action has taken place at night. 

**Don’t let background birds spoil the illusion!** 

## Be Willing to Invest
*More for the Production Manager than the audio guys themselves - but still a good point regardless.*
  
The quality of the Soundtrack can be difference between a cheap sounding production and a professional one. Don’t blow all of the budget on the best cameras and forget about audio. Hiring a professional sound recordist is your best bet for capturing good sound audio that wont take forever to clean up later.

The audio makes up 1/2 the experience that the audience see. With this in mind, you have to understand that sound isn’t something you can simply worry about later. So plan ahead, think about the sounds you’ll need and how you’ll get them.

# Shotgun & Lavalier Mics / Boom Operation
• [Location Sound Resource Videos](https://sites.google.com/sae.edu/aud213unitsite/resources/location-sound#h.tuhfhlshogju) • [How Shotgun Mics Work - SHURE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3LSEnI3ko0&t=331s) • [Operating a Boom Mic - Film Craft 107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6LqibtC-5g) • [Boom Mic Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxpvbwE8Hvw) •

Shotgun Mics are better are better at rejecting ambient noise and off-axis sound sources, though it is more suseptible to wind noise compared to conventional mics.
These microphones are Uni-Directional with a slotted tube called: **An Interference Tube.**
The length of this Interference Tube directly correlates with how large or small the pickup angle is.
- Length of Interference Tube = <> Pickup Angle
- The longer the length = The smaller the angle

With a narrower pickup angle, this makes the shotgun mic a good option for recording sounds that are located a bit further away from our standing position.

The Shotgun Mic can mounted in an assortment of ways:
- Boom - Held / Fixed
- Piston Grip
  - Good for SFX that need to be recorded outside
- On Camera
  - Sometimes noise from the camera, its fixtures or mounting claps can make noise that the mic will pickup - ensure that theres enough seperating the microphone / minimising vibrations from the camera

For wind noise, different attachments can be used to minimise or eliminate their sound.
- **Inside** - A foam screen is sometimes used when recording inside, this can minimise unwanted noises if the microphone is moved quickly
- **Outside** - A windshield called a: Zepplin / Blimp can be used when recording outside. Consists of materials layers that diffuse wind sound without affecting sound quality
  - A Fur cover can also be put ontop of the Zepplin / Blimp - this makes even the harshest of weather still possible to record good audio
