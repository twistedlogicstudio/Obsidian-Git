The Sound Report must be filled out during the shoot and passed onto the Post Production Engineer. If not done properly itâ€™ll be difficult to organsie the location audio recordings whichâ€™ll waste a lot of time. 

  *eg.* - Locating your room tone, atmos & wild take recordings will be time consuming in post production.

# Quick Reference Review Questions

- ### On the F8, should you connect the headphones to â€˜Sub 1/2 outâ€™?
	No you should connect the headphones into the headphone jack output, as putting it into the SUB OUT 1/2 minijack, you can low headphone volume or lots of noise.

- ### What settings should you make to prepare the F8 recorder for a shoot?
	At the start you can do a factory reset on the system to wipe any possible settings that you might not want, that isnâ€™t immediately visble to you. 
	
	You might also want to format the SD card thatâ€™s installed, to make sure that thereâ€™s enough room on there for everything you want to record.
	
	Setting the record file format to â€˜Multichannel Poly WAVâ€™ is also a good idea when recording for things like film.
  - MENU > REC > Rec to SD1 > Track 1-8 (Poly WAV)

- ### What should the sample rate and bitrate be set to for film sound?
	Audio recorded for film should be set to: 48kHz, 24 Bit

- ### Why is phantom power needed?
	Shotgun Mics are condenser Microphones which need +48V
	
	**TIP** - Some shotgun mics can be powered by AA batteries, BUT you donâ€™t get a warning when the batteries are low or have run out, so to play on the side of caution, itâ€™s best to take them out and use +48V instead. 

- ### Where in the Zoom F8 Menu do you activate/deactivate Phantom Power?
	MENU > INPUT > Phantom > On/Off and turn ON phantom power for input 1

- ### How many AA batteries does a Sennheiser G3 wireless kit need?
	4 x For each kit - (2 x for the Reciever / 2 x for the Transmitter)
	Keeping some spares is always a good idea, you never know when you might just need an extra couple of batteries, and you donâ€™t want to be the guy to halt or delay shooting because you didnt have batteries for your equipment.

- ### Name the useful feature on the Zoom F8 (and all location recorders), that can limit incoming volume peaks when a loud sound would have otherwise clipped past 0dBFS:
	Using the Limiter function will stop the sound from peaking above 0dbFS, but another useful feature is to set the record arm to â€˜Dual Channel Record Modeâ€™ - this will set the input directly opposite (Input 1 - Input 5 DUAL / Input 2 - Input 6 DUAL, etc) to record at -12dbFS lower. 
	
	This offers you a â€˜safety netâ€™ incase you accidentally peak on your input, although you do lose access to the opposing inputs.

- ### Describe how to sync radio frequencies between the Sennheiser G3 wireless transmitter and receiver:
	- Turn on both units (ON/OFF button located under front panel also) click the â€˜SETâ€™ button
	- On the reciever unit scroll through the menus and select â€™SYNCâ€™, then face the reciever and transmitter 
	- Both the Transmitter and the Reciever have an infra-red interface located under the front panel. Face botht the Transmitter & Reciever Infrared Screens towards eachother. 
	- Youâ€™ll know theyâ€™ve synced once a tick symbol has been displayed.


- ### Why is it important for the on-set sound recordist to fill in the Sound Report throughout the filming process?
	This process is important as the Post Production Engineer, might have a huge of amount of recordings to sift through, having a proper Sound Report can effectively mitigate the amount of time wasted by giving them information to help them locate the recording they need.
