# Brief
The film project is a collaboration between Film & Audio disciplines.
You will work on a film recording production dialogue, and, where possible, work on the same project in Post Production Roles. You are to take on multiple roles (minimum 2), these may include (but not limited to):

- **On Set:** 
  In a location sound team of 2, on set, you‚Äôll be location Sound Recordist, Production Sound Mixer, Boom Operator, or ‚ÄòSound Assistant‚Äô
- **Post Production:**
  Sound Designer, Sound FX Editor, Music Editor, Screen Composer, Foley Engineer, Foley Artist, Foley Editor, Dialogue Editor, Re-Recording Engineer ADR, ADR Editor, Mixer or Re-Recording Engineer, Sound Supervisor.
- **Composer:** 
  In some cases, there may be a need for a bespoke score to be composed by the appropriate audio student.

Film & Audio students are responsible to each other for self-organising oneself and working as a team.
Audio students will be responsible for the audio tech runs and workflow management, gear familiarisation, gear checks, transportation to and from the set, working on set WHS, data handling & backups. NB Location audio gear is booked and returned by the film students (due to booking reasons).

Film (Director, Producer, and Editor) and Audio students attend a spotting session.

Feedback session allocations for in-class review for the Film project WIP in the Scheme of works.
ALL Post-production workshops will be delivered ‚ÄúJust in Time‚Äù for students, who will then practise the skills learned in workshops on the chosen Film group project.
The Film Producer or Production Manager will handle group communication on these projects. (This should be set up during Pitching and Onboarding sessions.) The facilitator should also be included in the communications (Slack or Discord) to monitor communication between group members and facilitate personalised or group mentoring where necessary.
