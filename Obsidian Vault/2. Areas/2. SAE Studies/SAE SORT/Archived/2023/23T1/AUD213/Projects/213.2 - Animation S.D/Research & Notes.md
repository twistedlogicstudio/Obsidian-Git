From Bing AI:
### ”What are the characteristics that make a song sound like it should be in a Spy Movie?”

That's an interesting question. According to some sources²⁴, spy music is a genre of film music that is often used to create a sense of suspense, intrigue and mystery. Some of the characteristics that make a song sound like it should be in a spy movie are:

- **Soaring strings**, which can create a sense of drama and emotion.
- **Reverb-ed guitars**, which can add a touch of coolness and sophistication.
- **Open smooth beat**, which can provide a steady rhythm and contrast with the action on the screen.
- **Suave bass line**, which can give a sense of groove and movement.
- **Short, staccato hits from wind instruments**, which can punctuate major plot changes and action scenes.

Some examples of songs that have these characteristics are:

- "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" by John Barry²
- "From Russia With Love" by John Barry²
- "The Pink Panther Theme" by Henry Mancini²
