## Notes
Some ideas for notable things around the house that could be spliced in later with Foley

- wall clock
- wind chimes
- things around the garden
- shed itself (maybe some creaking or something)
- Garden Tools
- Room ambience

From doing the test shoot something to remember for next time is to definitely prepare yourself as much as possible, as early as possible. This should include things like printing off documents prior, as well as definitely bring food / coffee / snacks.

## Notes
Same as mentioned before make sure to print off documents prior to the day, as well as bring something like a clipboard so you can actually write stuff down properly - todays Sound Report, over half the notes written down were illegible coming back to it later.
Again forgot to bring snacks & coffee, definitely hit a wall half way through the day.

# Shoot Day 2
Monday 27th March 2PM

## Notes
For level metering, think it might be easier to just use PEAK - instead of PEAK & VU
Forgot to bring my headphones in today /  definitely need to remember it for next time - canâ€™t control the headphone levels when itâ€™s plugged into SUB/OUT - kind of sounds distorted as well 
Monitoring level - is NOT headphone level - didnâ€™t realise till a bit late 

Definitely need to check wether the trim / gain level, as well as the monitoring level (headphones) are out of whack because of the SUBOUT jack instead of Headphones

We really seemed to be getting a long a lot more, joking around and everything
