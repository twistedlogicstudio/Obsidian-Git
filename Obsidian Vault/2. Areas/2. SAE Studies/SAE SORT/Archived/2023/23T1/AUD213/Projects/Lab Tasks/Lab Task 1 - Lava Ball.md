## Sound Design Process
When first watching the video, conceptualising the ideas that I wanted to put down, I noted the weirdly futuristic-esque, space vibe to it, and when noticing how the explosion happens:

- kind-of vibrates, then flashes the screen before exploding outwards, with the final part of the sequence looking like it had made a tear in space-time itself, leaking lava goo 

I almost instantly thought of the (arguably the best explosion sound ever created) Star Wars - Seismic Charge.
So with this in mind I wanted to incorporate some of the sound design ideas used for the Seismic Charge as well as giving the Lava Ball an almost life like-alienesque nature.

Firstly I outlined different parts of the video I think had the most important moments, labelling some markers with the most notable idea I wanted to put across that section.

Once this was done, I wanted to tackle the idea I thought would be the most challenging:

- The Seismic Charge - Explosion Sound

After giving the sound a bit of a listen beforehand I was thinking that some sort of metallic spring sound, heavily distorted might achieve this. So with that idea, I used a Guitar Note sample and began processing it to see if I could get anywhere near the sound I was thinking.

I then proceeded to mess around with some more sounds to flesh out the soundscape, pulling in things like atmospheres and rumbles. After some trial and error, some editing and processing, I then made sure to put in a small gap, just before the explosions transient. This idea coming again from the Seismic Charge, where beforehand is almost like a suction sound, leading to a brief silence, then the explosion.
I think this really adds to the impact of the explosion, making it feel magnitudes larger with minimal effort.

After some more time processing & editing samples I grouped them into 3 different sections. I just find this really helps me to organise the project, helping to keep on track where things are and where different associated sounds might be.

# Task Reflection
The last couple of Trimesters I was stuck doing only CIM units, so off the bat I was already super excited to see we were doing some Sound Design stuff. Though it being so long since I'd properly jumped into this sort of work I definitely felt a tad rusty, and the added 1Hour time limit felt a lot more stressful than I initially thought.
This in the end is what I think made the activity really fun though, putting a hard cap on how much time you get to spend making the sounds felt weirdly liberating as I often fall victim to my own perfectionism. Forever tweaking little things and overthinking projects till I mentally bar myself by being overwhelmed. 
I think this could be a good way to practise working through these faults - Give myself small challenges, with a fixed time limit, whatever's done in that time - is done. This'll be a good way to hone my skills and my workflow.

An idea that this task did give me was: 
- To spend some time on a day off or something, building some FX racks / chains - route them in interesting ways and save them as templates. So next time I do some Sound Design Sessions, I'll already have a bunch of tools ready to go!
