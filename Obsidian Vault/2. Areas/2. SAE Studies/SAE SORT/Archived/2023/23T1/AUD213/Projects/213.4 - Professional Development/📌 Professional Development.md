# Brief
Professional Practice refers to the actions and endeavours undertaken to apply acquired knowledge to a specific industry, occupation, or work environment. During the course of this trimester, you will engage in various activities designed to enhance both technical proficiency and writing aptitude.
These activities may include assignments given by your facilitator or self-directed projects. Maintaining thorough documentation of the work process serves as an effective means of demonstrating critical thinking and research capabilities. 
This project serves as an opportunity for you to document your participation in these tasks and for these outcomes to be factored into your final course grade.
