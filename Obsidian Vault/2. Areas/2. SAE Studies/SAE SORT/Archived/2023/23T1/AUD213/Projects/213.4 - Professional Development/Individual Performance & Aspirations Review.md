# 4 Most Important Transferable Skills
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/unknown.png|unknown.png]]

## Time Management
My time management has always been a bit of a weak point for me unfortunately, though with some of the previous trimesters it was more due to overdoing things, thinking that I wouldn't burn out working 2 x jobs as well as studying. With it being a point of contention for me I've tried to continually work on it, finding out more about myself and the way I need to structure my workflow to be able to most effectively get things done.
Things like simplifying some parts of the process, *eg:*

- Note taking needs to be super simple for me, even right down to the app that I use. The start of this trimester I was using an app called â€˜Obsidianâ€™ which is basically fully customisable right down to even using code to alter any part of the UI / app. This ended up with me wasting *HOURS* customising and trying to perfect the ultimate system.
- Realising this I knew that I needed to find something that I can use, that ultimately comes down to 1 main thing - writing & organising my notes 

This definitely has helped and streamlined the process for me, the only thing being that I changed platforms just after the start of the trimester, which should have been fine, but in the end did cause some disruptions â€˜ironingâ€™ out some kinks in the system (attachments, folders etc. not working)

As well as this I did actually quit my current job as well, with the amount of work that we needed to do this trimester as well as wanting to be able to put in as much time & effort as possible, I needed to cut down the hours I was doing. Unfortunately with some workplaces they arenâ€™t as flexible as others, and with the current situation, the best course of action was to hand in my resignation.

### Summary (TLDR)
All in all I think I have progressed from earlier trimesters though I do still need some more time to work on my time management. From things like simplifying the process, breaking things down and time blocking my tasks should help me be better, now I just have to keep at it so that it becomes habit.

## Communication
My communication in general can be seriously lacking, especially when things start to get a little hectic. I think this is also partly due to my lacking Time Management skills, as when things start to pile up, I can get overwhelmed especially when Iâ€™m not on top of things. 
This can lead to a sort of â€˜burn outâ€™ where I kind of topple over in a sense, where I find that removing myself completely seems to get me back to ground zero where I feel like I can jump back into the work.

This isnâ€™t the best place to be for either myself or anyone that I may be working with as with projects, especially bigger ones, thereâ€™s a lot of moving parts, and with that each piece somewhere relies on another, so If I was to suddenly bail out due to burn out, I could be leaving people who are relying on me completing my work to then do theirs, high and dry. 

Being a future creative professional I really cannot let this happen, as a lot of the time, first impressions mean everything. And if I was to jump on a new project, get overwhelmed then fail my co-workers, it could lead to growing a reputation of not being able to do the work needed.
Once this is attached to your name, it could be hard to remove yourself from it. 

So for this I need to keep a few things in mind, practise good Time Management make it a habit, and be self aware enough to not only take on too much work that I lead to burn out, but to also be aware of the warning signs of burn out, and have strategies for mitigating the worst of it.

### Summary (TLDR)
Much like Time Management, communication has been a bit of a weak point for me previously. Sometimes when I get overwhelmed, be it due to overdoing things and burning out, or by poor Time Management, I can sometimes end up in a place where I feel the need to completely remove myself to in a sense â€˜reset.â€™ 
This can be bad for both myself, my reputation and the people I might be working with.
So moving forward I need to ensure that I keep working on my Time Management, as well as being self aware enough to realise when things are getting too much, and having strategies ready to mitigate the worst of it.

## Project Management
I think this ties in pretty well with Time Management as a whole, as to have good Project Management you need a strong base of Time Management Skills. However I think this goes a little deeper, as good Project Management I think requires a good sense of vision, and by this I mean having an understanding of the Project Pipeline, how long things should take as well as the weight of importance that each task within the project holds - balancing each of these parts and adjusting things to ensure that the project reaches its deadlines, milestones & goals in the best quality possible.

To practise and hone my skills of Project Management, I should from the start of the project break things down, and draw out a pipeline of what needs to be done, and by what time. This way I can see from a â€˜Birds Eye viewâ€™ the whole timeline that the project must take. This will also ensure that tasks are achievable within the time given, as well as showing different places where things might need to be shuffled around or changed in whatever way.

As well as breaking down all of the tasks, creating a timeline and time blocking everything - another layer of good practise should be to document everything, leaving enough room & flexibility for changes to be made, ensuring that everyone involved isnâ€™t left in a difficult situation.

## Use Constructive Criticism
This is one of my major Transferable Skills because I can understand the importance of not only Reflective work, but seeking & using feedback to further hone skills. 
In previous trimesters & work I have been a bit reluctant or shy about seeking feedback & criticism. I think that this comes from a couple of places:

- Growing up in a background where failure wasnâ€™t laid out in a good light
  - This I think has led me to grow a sense of pride with my work, where sometimes I can feel that criticism is akin to an attack of my work, instead of a chance for growth
- General shyness when in situations Iâ€™m not 100% comfortable in
  - A touch on the previous point I think that I can become a little uncomfortable with things that Iâ€™m not the best at
