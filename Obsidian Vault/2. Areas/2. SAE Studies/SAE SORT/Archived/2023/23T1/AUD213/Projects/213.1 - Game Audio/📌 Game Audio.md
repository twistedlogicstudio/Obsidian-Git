# Brief
In this project, you will complete both the sound design and audio implementation for a supplied game level. This will involve planning out the sound design, production of suitable audio assets and implementing sounds within a game engine. 
You will present research and develop workflows for game audio production and build foundational skills for implementing audio, music and FX with a game.
Player immersion in gameplay is the goal of this sound design project, along with a demonstration of skilful audio implementation techniques.
You will showcase your final sound design in a 7-10 minute class presentation, discussing processes, challenges and skills developed that will be timetabled by your facilitator.

# Steps to Follow
1. Embed a spreadsheet (eg. Google Sheets) on your project page to develop your asset list. Indicates the sounds needed throughout the game level, where each sound is required (eg. Cave, Forest, Swap, etc.) approximate  audible range of the sound in meters, and how the sound was created or where it was sourced from.
   ==Minimum of 30 sounds.==
2. Source / Record / Produce these sounds as required.
3. Import each of those sounds into a DAW and appropriately process them ready for implementation into the game, eg: 
	- Gain for appropriate relative loudness
	- EQ to match tone
	- Apply creative effects as deemed appropriate
	- Trim atmospheres as loops, trim bird chirps into short single tweets
	- Export each audio clip and upload each sound to a Google Folder embedded on your project page.
	- The names of these audio files should match those in the audio asset list.
4. Import the audio clips into the game level (either directly into the game engine or via audio middleware such as FMOD). Implement the sounds into the game level using your asset list as a guide.
5. Applying appropriate settings for each audio source. 
	1. Sounds are to be placed across the full level (e.g. no silent spots) with a ==minimum of 50 audio sources== included throughout the level. Implementation is to include the use of positional and non-positional audio, distance attenuation and reverb zones. 
	2. Apply an appropriate mix across the level using the game engine or audio middleware mixer, with the application of in-game audio effects (demonstrating the use of both insert and aux send audio effects).
6. Seek and document feedback from your peers and facilitator on work in progress (WIP) throughout the project.
7. Screen capture 2 - 3 minutes of gameplay of your completed level (with sound) and embed the video on your project page. The video should be appropriate as a portfolio piece, work to avoid jarring movements and consider how to move around the level in a manner that is flattering for your presentation.
8. Zip the game project (e.g. the Unity project), upload the zip to your Google Drive and include a link to the zip on your project page.
9. Submit your project with two 250-word project reflections, as outlined below: (1) a mid-project reflection and (2) a project-completion reflection.
10. Deliver a 7-10 minute presentation at a scheduled date & time as directed by your facilitator, showcasing your sound design using the screen-captured video. Discussing processes, challenges and skills developed. Highlight and include interesting points found through your self-directed research.

# Deliverables
Documentation of the project development (including screenshots and/or video), and the following included in your Learning Journal:

- Screen-recorded video of the gameplay (2 - 3 minutes) showcasing your final sound design. The video is to be embedded in your Learning Journal and provided as a downloadable link.
- Self-directed game audio research (minimum 500 words with four APA7 references & in-text citations) presented on your project page for highlighting as part of your class presentation.
- Audio asset list embedded as a spreadsheet (e.g. Google Sheets) on your project page.
- Google Folder embedded on your project page containing the final audio clips used in the game level. The naming of these audio files will correlate to the audio asset list.
- Upload the game project (e.g. the Unity project) as a zip file to your Google Drive, with the download link on your project page.
- Make sure all related content for your project is correctly shared with mailto:moderation\_au@sae.edu
