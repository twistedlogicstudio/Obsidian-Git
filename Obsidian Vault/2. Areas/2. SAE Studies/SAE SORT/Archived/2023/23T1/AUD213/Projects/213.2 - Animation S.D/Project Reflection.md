# Mid Project Reflection
> [!info]- 
> Include the mid-project reflection with your project submission. In 250 words, address each of the prompts with examples from your project:
> - How you developed your technical skills and knowledge
> - How have you improved your workflows and processes
> - How you developed your communication and collaboration skills

This project technically started off right from WK1 this trimester, and even though I was a little bit late to jump into the class, I felt like I more or less hit the ground running on this project. 
Unfortunately due to some peers dropping out, some groups were left with minimal members, so I jumped from my group to another. This wasn't too much of an issue as we hadn't really gotten moving yet with my previous group, and the work I had done was really just laying down some ideas for the music, and the organisational work for the incoming foley sessions.

After moving though, I did initially feel like I didn't have the same chemistry with these guys, as I did with the first group. This I think will be a good chance to practise my skills of learning to work with all sorts of people, as in the workplace, were not always going to be working with people just like us, or people that we necessarily enjoy.
Though after a couple of weeks with them I can already feel myself getting a little frustrated. After the initial move over, we hadn't even organised a line of communication between us for almost 2-3 weeks.

They definitely seem a lot less eager about the work, finding it hard to bounce ideas with them, as well as it being almost a grind just to get basic feedback, even when in studio. I normally really enjoy foley, but days are feeling like they drag on a-bit when I keep getting dumped in the studio (don't think anyone else enjoys performing foley, fair enough) and kind of fumbling around cause I can't get more than "yeah, that's alright" or "nah, go again."

I definitely need to figure out how to toe the fine line between assertive / too much, as I think I more often than not bite my tongue in these situations cause I don't want to come off as 'too much' but as a result often don't get across some things that I really feel I should.
Also I can understand that each person enjoys different things, so if foley isn't their niche I can understand if someone isn't as eager for the work as others.

> - What obstacles you faced and how you overcame them
> - How you will improve your skills for future projects

### Note:
I don’t want it to seem like I’m only having a dig at my group members, I understand this trimester has been pretty tough, with multiple projects going on all at once, and generally a lot of work to juggle. Just keeping notes of my experience, and trying to figure out ways to grow from them.

Moving further into the project, I do keep finding myself getting more and more frustrated unfortunately. Like I’d stated in my Mid-Project Reflection I’m not sure that these guys are as into it as I am, and again I can understand that if something isn’t your particular niche it might be hard to stay motivated with the tasks, but when in a group I think there’s a baseline ‘codes of practise’ that each should be working with. 

A bit part of that being a good line of communication, and acknowledgement of each other especially when discussing project work. Unfortunately I do find that things are a bit one sided, multiple attempts to try and discuss things have ended up more or less a little dry. After a mid-project milestone and checkup on how we were going, I did say to the group we should lay everything that still needs to be done out, and divi out the tasks, unfortunately as usual I was left with nothing. Not only this a big challenge I am finding is a good medium between the different creative outlooks.
Being an animation, I have the outlook that the sounds need to be somewhat stylised or OTT, where as others in the group want to remain strictly grounded in realism, referring a lot of the time to outlines and things said in class or the brief (even though project briefs at SAE can sometimes be interpreted a multitude of different ways). So with this I don’t know if it’s me being too eager to stretch out beyond the outline or purely a creative difference, maybe even a bit of both.
Nonetheless this could be a good lesson on how to deal with differences in creative ideas.

With this unit and this project, I do see it as a good opportunity to do some cool work & projects to fill out the portfolio, so in the scheme of things I don’t mind doing a bit extra to ensure that the projects done here are the best possible, though it does show that one of the things I really need to work on the most is being able to get the best possible work out of the people I’m teamed up with. Like how a recording engineer has to have some tricks up their sleeve to get the vocalist or musician to feel comfortable in order to get the best possible performance.

Other than the group in general I have still really enjoyed working on this project, I already quite enjoyed Sound Design & Foley, but liked the challenge of aiming to do the sounds from scratch utilising only recordings or personally designed sounds. I feel like it’s forced me into thinking outside the box to achieve certain sounds - from using a synth to add a layer to the hair clipper recordings, giving it more of a ‘beating’ oomph, to using a noise oscillator and modulating its pitch to give the elevator the sound of it slowing down when it nears the bottom, to as well using a noise oscillator to design the sound of the laser pointer. All of these sounds I would have normally used a sample library and built them with layers - instead I arguably made more interesting sounds building it myself.

As for me music, I’ve definitely done my fair share of production in the past, but I took the opportunity to use this project as a challenge to stretch myself into writing music with direct objectives - to try and touch on certain emotional cues, to fit the theme, and most importantly to aid the screen, not be the centre piece.

This was at first a bit of  struggle for me as I don’t have any classical training in musical theory (drums & percussion sheet music don’t utilise musical notes / keys unfortunately) but after some research into the music of famous spy movies like James Bond, and tapping into almost forgotten years in the jazz and concert bands in high school I managed to find a bit of a creative flow, which by the end had me thoroughly enjoying it, a lot more than I thought I would.

All in all, it goes to shows the importance of outlining the creative ideas / direction, which can help inform the research, which as I keep on learning is a skill that I’ll be using all throughout the future of (hopefully) my career.

### Notes:
- Sometimes I don’t think group members are matching the effort or energy with this project - understandable that sometimes when you don’t enjoy a particular project / task / niche of audio work - can definitely be hard to stay motivated, or even match the same energy / effort or work of someone that does enjoy it BUT…..
- Some things that I think are at least basic ‘codes of practise’ when working in a group or with other people - when there’s an open line of communication - acknowledge and discuss the things that were brought up
  - *eg* - Studio session (WK
- By Back end of project - really starting to not enjoy working with these guys - tried to be communicative but get basically nothing from these guys - eg. We were struggling to get punching recordings - went and recorded some stuff I thought was cool, in my own time cause no one else seemed to be doing anything about it - brought it up, and all I get is ‘ok’ … nothing else 
- Week before our mixing workshop brought up that we have somethings that still need to be done, I still have to do the rest of the music, and have already said I’d do some more recording stuff, so with too much on my plate to do everything else, I suggested that we should go through and outline everything we have left to do, then we can divi out the tasks between us - again, got nothing from these guys - now in the FOR THE WORKSHOP, and they start asking / talking about what else do we need to do NOW… ? 
- Creatively I don’t think we agree on much either - being an animation I thought that we can go with a ‘hyper realism (OTT)’ / stylised mentality with some of the sounds - but they always kind of turned these ideas, more or less always choosing the path of whats sounds more realistic (in life) 
- Even right near the end - they were saying nah don’t wanna book anymore foley time - its so boring…
- They’re always so quick to bail out of tasks / jobs they don’t like, not that good at or don’t want to do - that’s fine, there’s things we all don’t like to do but being in a group, should at least stay involved, add some ideas, give feedback or something
- Remember to preface your reflection - Understand that everyone enjoys different things but its hard working on a big project with people that don’t seem to even want to be creative and shit - 
- Filled out my own FX Spotting sheet, THEY STILL HAVENT DONE IT
- wasting time playing around with s
