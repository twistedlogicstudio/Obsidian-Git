# Music
## TLDR (Summary)
> - Michael (UP’s Composer) uses 1 singular chord / identity to sum up feeling (UP - FMAJ 7 - ‘Ellie’s Theme’)
> - This musical identity can be tied to the theme or even a character and their relation to others in the story
> - Physicality Matters (kind of) *eg* - Big Animal = Low Roar / Small Animal = High Squeaks. Sad, low energy - Slow simple music.
>   - But we can use contrast sometimes to achieve certain emotional intelligence. 
> - Context is key - for things that can teeter on the fence of either camps / context (the scene for example) is the guide that helps the audience understand

## General Notes
Breaking down Up’s iconic scene & it’s music. This could give some ideas as to how you might want to approach writing.

Michael Giacchino, composer for UP, speaks on how we went about writing the music for the film. He likes to have his music to have 1 main identity, specifically for UP he says he wanted to sum up the feeling in 1 chord - that being FMAJ 7 - saying that it has a tinge of sadness to it / kinda happy, kinda not.

Now if we look at this and add the idea of wrapping it around a theme, we can see that this singular chord and the iconic motif is Ellies theme, it encapsulates her as a person, her sense of adventure, her emotions, and her presence in Fredricks life, building upon & breaking down of the musical motif as we journey through the ups & downs of their life.

When looking at this we can also point to another ideal that can help. 

- Physicality Matters (kind of)
- Context is Key

When we think of something large, imposing and aggressive, we automatically think that it’ll have a low, guttural ‘roar’ in a sense - and vice versa, something small would have a high pitch squeak. 
So when we think of someone thats sad and depressed, we think ‘low, no energy, not much going on other than pain and misery’ - this translates to slow, simple melodies & instrumentation - lower down the register.

For Context when we have something that can sit in the middle, something (like this FMAJ 7) that sits kinda in both camps, context is the guide that helps the audience understand.

- *For Example* - In UP when Ellie’s at the doctor, finding out she’s sick, the music simplifies to a simple piano, dropping lower and slowing down in tempo. 
- In contrast when her and Fredrick are first married - the tempo is quick, the motif builds on itself into a light, fun playful number
