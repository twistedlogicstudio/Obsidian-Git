> Watch the videos below to get a sense of the current state of VR and the Unity Game Engine. In particular, watch the dedicated Unity video walkthrough: How to use AUDIO SOURCES in Unity - Basics to get the fundamental concepts for positioning audio within 3D environments. In fact, this is very similar to 'object based' panning in Dolby Atmos. Except of course you're able to move your listening position (e.g. characters ears) around your audio in 3D space. Cool huh!

> [!RESEARCH]
> Research the technical requirements for delivering audio into the two main Game Engines (Unity and Unreal Engine) - e.g. what audio formats, sample rates and bit rate(s) will they accept and prefer. This will be handy information as you develop audio assets for Games Students. Note your findings in your Learning Journal, ready to share your findings in class.
