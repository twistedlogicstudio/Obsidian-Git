Here's the initial Game Asset List I had written up in the planning phase. I was continuing to add to it whilst working through the Sound Design phase & while I was working through FMOD and its implementation.

# FMOD
After firstly diving into Unity seeing what the stock audio engine does, and comparing it to FMOD, I had planned to implement all of my audio through FMOD, as it seemed a lot easier to implement a lot more complex audio systems, as well as having a more â€˜DAW centricâ€™ UI, I had high hopes. Unfortunately after some time designing some sounds and their variants, putting it into FMOD and laying out some systems for randomisation, trying to actually implement it into Unity was a nightmare. 
I tried following the tutorials posted on both the offical FMOD pages as well as some of the resources linked in the SAE unit page. But I couldnâ€™t for the life of me to get it working, not only this, I couldnâ€™t seem to backpedal what I did to revert back into the stock Unity audio engine, and essentially locked myself out of any usable audio. 
So after pulling my hair out for almost 2 weeks trying to get it all working to no avail, I had to ditch it and essentially start from scratch, though I still had my designed sounds.

- Having the designed sounds in the end didnâ€™t really help, as I had not properly spent the time inside the actual game level, which accumulated to having some of my sounds not really fitting the aesthetic. As well as the ideas I had to implement some of the sounds now wasnâ€™t really possible (unless I learnt a lot more C# scripting) so in the end I had to simplify a lot of the sounds I had already done.

# Game Audio Implementation
After the big debacle I had already put myself quite far behind, so as much as I hate it I had to accept putting less time & effort into polish, and just to focus on getting sounds into the game and everything balanced & working.

## River Spline
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-27 at 03.10.40.png|CleanShot 2023-03-27 at 03.10.40.png]]
The river had already been laid out so fortunately I only had to put in the audio. I did however end up with a weird bug where (only occasionally) the audio would glitch out completely after putting in a Reverb Zone for one of the Caves. I figured that the end of the river ends in the particular cave, and for some reason would mess up the audio. I eventually just cut my losses and muted the Cave Reverb Zone, as the location already sounded pretty much bang on what I wanted anyways, the Reverb Zone wasnâ€™t exactly adding much to the experience.

## Bridges
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-27 at 03.16.50.png|CleanShot 2023-03-27 at 03.16.50.png]]
The Bridges were more or less done through adding in assets for the â€˜Woodâ€™ footsteps collection, I did design my own jumping sounds though I had to take out the â€˜landingâ€™ sound as for some reason when the character walks over the bridge sometimes glitches over the wooden planks, and for some reason bugs out the audio to play the *jump landing* sound instead of the footsteps. 

- *Note:* I ended up going back & editing the audio, balancing it better etc. & the issues seemed to be less of a thing.
  
To add a subtle element to the bridge and to further fill out the sound, I added the Creaky Wood sample to the bridge with a small radius.

## Ponds
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.36.52@2x.png|CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.36.52@2x.png]]

The Pond areas have a couple of sounds around it, firstly being the â€˜ambienceâ€™ which is a simple loop with frogs & insects etc. To have this ambience not all seem like the same thing across the different ponds, I slightly changed their pitches, volumes and effective ranges. I did also quickly design a simple sound for the butterflies that hang around near the ponds (not too happy with it / would swap it out given a different timeframe & not having so many issues, but also wth do butterflies even sound like?!). As well as this, thereâ€™s an effect for some dust blowing, so I added a simple Wind sound loop, and pulled it down really low. 

## Swamp Area
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.43.14@2x.png|CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.43.14@2x.png]]
The Swamp Area right from the start was one of the areas I was keen to work on the most, which inevitably made this section one of the more complex parts of my map (sound wise). I firstly made 2 atmospheric drones from some melodic samples in Ableton, and layered it on-top of each other & the general ambience of the location (swamp sounds like: insects, owl hooting, etc). 
To add even more depth to ambience and vibe of the location I add in a â€˜Creaking Woodâ€™ looping sample that sits real low, but adds a cool sense that the Swamp is almost â€˜aliveâ€™ in a way. 
Footsteps for both the Swamp Edges & Swamp Water were added in via the Footsteps Collection Box

## Ruins
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.43.47@2x.png|CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.43.47@2x.png]]
The Ruins I think is a cool little landmark jutting out of some basic flat land. So I wanted the audio to prop up the idea that itâ€™s a bit of a special location. So with that I made another atmospheric drone in Ableton, using pretty much the same technique as before, though this time I made sure that the melodic sound that comes through in the sound was more of a nice, interesting vibe. However the range & radius for the sound for some reason took me forever to properly dial in, as I was having issues with it fading off nicely when moving away from the centre point.

![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.43.56.png|CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.43.56.png]]
I also ended up adding in a â€˜Trigger on Collisionâ€™ script to each of the pillars, so that each time that the player character walks into the pillars, it plays a short stone hit sample.

## Waterfall & Caves
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.39.46@2x.png|CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.39.46@2x.png]]
The Waterfall area being arguably the centre point of the map I wanted it to be a really nice, almost angelic sounding area. To achieve this I added in some more atmospheric drones, right in where the waterfall sound is, having it sit a bit under it. I think the waterfall sound itself is almost soothing in a way so the added atmos I felt needed to be subtle to have the best effect. 

- *(Upon revisiting, Iâ€™ve realised it might not be as subtle as I thought it was! Still like the effect though)*
  
Around the area I do also have some wind sounds (tied to the dust blowing effect again) as well as some more butterflies, these ones are slightly different again (via pitch). 

![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-28 at 11.24.01@2x.png|CleanShot 2023-03-28 at 11.24.01@2x.png]]
For the main cave section I used a basic Cave atmosphere, a low rumble & a dripping water sample - bounced it down in Ableton & layered it with another water dripping loop to emphasise that characteristic. 

## Campsite
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.41.57@2x.png|CleanShot 2023-03-17 at 16.41.57@2x.png]]
For the Campsite area I have a couple of things layered together to make its atmosphere, from a simple forrest ambience loop, as well as a musical atmosphere loop I made in Ableton. I wanted to give this area, again like most of the different areas around, itâ€™s own significant feel. The campfire in the middle also has a minimalistic fire / crackling wood loop over it.

## Trees, Bushes & Other Game Objects
For the Campsite area I have a couple of things layered together to make its atmosphere, from a simple forrest ambience loop, as well as a musical atmosphere loop I made in Ableton. I wanted to give this area, again like most of the different areas around, itâ€™s own significant feel. The campfire in the middle also has a minimalistic fire / crackling wood loop over it.
Similar to the Pillars in the Ruins section I ended up adding some audio to the foliage around the map, from the different types of trees around, to the bushes. Thereâ€™s quite a few different looking trees, and to not have the collision audio for them get annoying or tedious I ended up crafting around 2 - 5 different variations for each type. The initial thought process, given more time to figure out how to implement, I would have had another *footstep collection* type of system where I have the variations randomly firing upon each trigger for each tree or asset.

![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.42.37.png|CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.42.37.png]]
The bushes & shrubbery were laid out in the exact same way as the trees, with the initial intention being the same also. Although in the end I only ended up using 1 audio sample for each type of bush.

![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.44.33.png|CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.44.33.png]]The Skeletons around the map, as well as the treasure chests also have audio sources tied to them, done using a *trigger on collision* script like the Trees & Foliage. 

## Pickups
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.46.15.png|CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.46.15.png]]
The pickups in the game were one of the first things I started working on, I wanted a sound to play upon pickup, as well as a sort of â€˜humâ€™ or drone to play continuously around the Skulls, getting louder due to proximity. As a sort of way to guide the player towards the pickup. This however proved to be my first big problem to overcome. I couldnâ€™t figure out how to have the proximity audio play, and destroy itself upon the pickup of the Skull. This was such a pain for a while I ended up turning off the Skulls completely till later.

![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 04.38.39.png|CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 04.38.39.png]]
Once Iâ€™d learnt a bit more about Game Objects, Collision Boxes, Triggering and scripts I came back to this issue, though one big difference being that itâ€™s the complete opposite of what I was doing before. I didnâ€™t need to *trigger* an audio source to play upon collision, I needed it to *end.* This proved to be an issue for a while until Iâ€™d spent some time looking into the C# scripting language, realising that I can use the same script that the skulls were using (destroy on collision) and re-write the line in the script to *Stop* audio source, instead of *Play.*

## Simple Game Audio Balancing
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.42.15.png|CleanShot 2023-03-29 at 03.42.15.png]]
This was actually a system that I wished I started using with my workflow a lot earlier, as going back through each sound and touching up the volume individually gets tedious REALLY quick. As well as this, itâ€™s hard a lot of the time to be able to predict how loud an audio source & sample needs to be when youâ€™re editing or designing it, and when thereâ€™s a group or multiple assets that are using that sound or one of itâ€™s variants itâ€™s definitely handy to go back and only have to pull down 1 fader instead.
