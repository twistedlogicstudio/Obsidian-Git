This trimester has been super fun, one of my favourites so far. It's been great to work with different disciplines, learning the proper procedures that each entail. And it's been a bit of a cathartic moment with the heavy influx of side projects that have been thrown my way coming into the end of trimester - currently sitting on 4 different film projects at the moment. Though I think that this is a good point to show that I need to learn how to firstly say 'no' as well as to learn how to better gauge the workload incoming as well as what's a realistic output.

With having quite a bit left to do for SAE deliverables, I honestly shouldn't have jumped straight into these projects. I also think this is a good point to touch on my time management.

I think throughout the trimester I've done some really high quality work, although the thing that definitely brings me down a few pegs - is handing in deliverables on time, and I think this comes down to a couple of things:

- Time Management
- Perfectionism

Time Management I think has a lot less weight as an excuse now, as it's been an issue for me for the longest time. And it's come to be a lot more obvious that whatever I'm doing isn't working so well. So moving into the break I've planned to go through some courses on LinkedIN Learning, hopefully to try find a new process that might help with my arguably useless Time Management. As well as this I'm currently in the process with my GP to find a Psychiatrist to figure out wether things like this might actually be out of my control.

Other than this I think that I've really found a bit of a calling when it comes to future work opportunities - Film Sound.
I've thoroughly enjoyed every process of the Film Sound process, and think that I should definitely look at pursuing the different pathways that this career can offer.
Same with Game Audio actually, as even though I ran into a multitude of issues when working with Unity, I still actually really enjoyed the process of Sound Design & Implementation, where it seems to have a different kind of creativity - one where Sound Design needs to fit the aesthetic of the game as well as different things like 2D / 3D sound - how to properly implement & balance all the sounds together, as well as including a bit of coding, something that I've always had a bit of an interest in.

All in all I think that I've found some interesting pathways for the future in Audio, although there's definitely some things in my process of work that needs a lot of work and attention. As well as maybe finding a better process with note-taking, as I do everything inside of my own platforms - doubling up is just a waste of time - might be worth looking into somehow linking the 2 together
