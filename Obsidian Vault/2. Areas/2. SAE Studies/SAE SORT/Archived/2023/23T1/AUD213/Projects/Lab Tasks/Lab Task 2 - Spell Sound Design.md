## Sound Design Process
Firstly before doing anything else I wanted to map out the points in the video where each spell would be. This was initially done to make sure that the timings were spot on, as well as being able to switch between each of the sections / spells quickly.
In practise though it wasn‚Äôt nearly as helpful nor needed, as the video that was provided was to be used more as a guideline / inspiration, than as a strict specification for audio timing.

After this I went through my sample bank & threw into the Ableton timeline anything that I thought might fit the sound aesthetic of the spell.
Once I thought I had enough, I chopped, changed, stretched & skewed the samples to fit, putting them into sort of groups / layers usually consisting of something like:

- Impact Layer
- Environmental Layer
- Lead-up / Windup Layer
- Tail / Finishing Layer

As well as this I incorporated some audio effects / processing on some of the layers. To add more of a Dynamic Feel & some movement to the sounds I automated some of the parameters - *eg.* 
The Ice Cracking Layer - I automated the effect ‚ÄòRedux‚Äù to reduce the sample rate right down near the end of the audio sequence to have more of an edge - snap to the sound.

After I‚Äôd done this and was happy enough with the sound of the spell so far I bounced / consolidated it down to a singular stereo audio file, to then process again for some slight variations.
To do the variations I loaded up an effects group where I‚Äôd split the frequency range into 3 parts 

- High End
- Mid Range
- Low End 

This way I can achieve a more subtle effect on the sample without affecting other regions of the frequency range if I don‚Äôt need to. 
*For Example:*
I used this technique on the Fire Spell samples, this was because when using Ableton's Phaser-Flanger, It would start to modulate the whole frequency range - including the low end. I felt like this was a cool effect yes but also took out a lot of weight and energy out of the sound. I thought that this might result in too much of a difference in sound which might in turn, pull the audience out of the immersion & the experience.

Another way that I chose to use this same technique was to put a Band Pass Filter on the mid range layer, that way I can make all sorts of sweeping sounds, giving the sample even more movement, without being too far from the original.
I can then loop it, while recording into another audio track endlessly playing around. After I can then drop down the Take Lanes, audition them, and pick the ones I like most.

# Task Reflection
Coming off the back of the last Lab Task (LAVA-BALL) I think I might have let my ego get the better of me. I was super confident that it‚Äôd be an absolute sinch, but I didn‚Äôt end up considering how little 1 hour was to actually do 3 x Spell Sounds, as well as their variants.

With this being the case, I didn‚Äôt properly time block the 3 sounds I needed to do, and thus the later into the hour I got, the more rushed I ended up being.

Upon looking back on the sound design session, I do think that maybe I don‚Äôt completely understand the relationship with sound design, complexity and the project *as a whole.*
I think I ended up having such intricate and complex Sound Design ideas in my head, that it might have played out against me in the end.

*I came to this conclusion from thinking:*

- (Depending on the game) Sound can be a main part of the ‚ÄòCombat Awareness‚Äô for players, where they use the audio cues from enemies to judge position / timing, etc. If the sounds of  the attacks that the player does, takes up a whole chunk of the audio spectrum, this might be a nightmare to mix later, as well as drowning out important sounds the player might need.

With this in mind, I definitely think a ‚Äòless is more‚Äô approach might be beneficial, and if need be I can always scale up later.
