# Objective
Like any role, from Lighting to Photography, Audio plays an important role in helping to deliver across the themes, message, and vibe of the film. Our objective is to best utilise our skills & knowledge, to create the audio as close to your vision as possible. 
But in order to do this, we need to both understand each other, as well as to maintaining an open line of communication.
## Process
>- Location Recording of Audio - Shoot Days
>   - Data Wrangler - Takes all audio / We take copy
> - Editors align audio with relevant shots & do their editing
> - Picture Lock gets handed to us with aligned audio
> - We cleanup this audio, make it sound as good as possible 
> - Add in any Foley
> - Add in Soundtrack & Music
> - Hand back for final edits / cleanup

# Project Vision
Whether itâ€™s music, voice-overs, sound effects or anything in between, describing the type of audio youâ€™re looking for will go hand-in-hand with the touch points and your target audience. For the audio team, it is important to know what, and for who, the music / audio is being made for. Itâ€™s like handing a painter the actual frame in which to fit the painting. Setting such boundaries helps us visualise the creative process clearly from start to finish and focus the creative energy into hitting the targets that are needed to reach the destination.

> Share any relevant info you guys might have on the project, anything discussing themes or emotions.

# Music & Audio References
For music and ambience, the best way to get the message across sometimes is to use examples, explaining what part of the examples you like.
*eg:*
- *I really like the â€˜low rumbleâ€™ in the background, and how it helps build tension for the jump scare in the next scene*

## Reference Dump
If you have a whole bunch of references / ideas, but donâ€™t have the time to explain them all - just dump them all here, all of it helps in the end
