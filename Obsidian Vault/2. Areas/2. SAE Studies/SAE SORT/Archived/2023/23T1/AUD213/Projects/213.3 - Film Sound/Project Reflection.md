## Feedback Notes 
Sat down after the last film day & de-briefed - talking about our own experience & giving everyone feedback

- Had the highest of praise for us - couldn’t believe that we had only just learnt location recording & that this was our 1st time on a film set 
- Said our work was super professional - comparable to professionals they’ve worked with 
- Only constructive criticism that they could find was that we could have asked about frame lines earlier - but even then only really day 1 as we got more confident by the end / in there checking frames anyways 
- Apparently a natural with the boom - great to work with & couldn’t be happier to get us as the audio team 
- Said we were super easy to get a long with - they’ve all been together since tri 1 (almost a year) but we just jumped in and fit in perfectly

> - How have you improved your workflows and processes
> - How you developed your communication and collaboration skills



- Initially thought that test shoot day might be unnecessary as well as it being last minute, but in the end was the best idea to go down.
- It is a bit annoying that it’s all the way down in Armadale, which ends up being like a 40 min trip - also annoying cause just quit job, Ubers are hectic expensive
- From the test shoot day & Shoot Day 1, definitely understand how important it is to prepare as much as you can prior - from things like looking at all of the necessary documentation (scenes, shots etc.) - as well as actually printing out docs like Sound Report - Cannot underestimate the importance of bringing food & snacks as well!!
- Being a duo of me & Romeo we decided to split the work by one person operating the Boom, and the other being on the Zoom & monitoring levels etc.
- On Test Shoot day we rotated jobs half way through - On Shoot Day 1, I put my hand up to operate the Boom which was fine by Romeo - I actually quite enjoy the job of operating the boom, kind of feels like I’m right in the middle of the action, as well as actually have a participating role in the process. I do need to figure out some more ways of mitigating fatigue when operating the Boom - can get a little sore after a while
- I found that after the first shoot day, communication with the Film Team was a lot more fluid, though on my end I did become less communicative over messaging, I do attribute this to being a little overwhelmed with everything this last week or so.
