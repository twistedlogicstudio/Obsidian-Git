# Brief
In this project youâ€™ll develop the sound design for a provided or sourced animation. 

In small groups or individually, choose one of the animation projects from these [Animation Clip Options](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18iK_WxQ_gBo0kszyQvWX28mDSNRt9bTg), or choose your own animation clip (must be signed off by your facilitator proceeding with the project).

Youâ€™ll work individually or together as a crew and are each responsible for self-organising the workflow, recording sessions, editing, SFX Gathering, music composition or acquisition, casting of actors, mixing, communications, and data management and session workflows.

At defined checkpoints have your work available during studio workshops for feedback or discussion, most importantly for set feedback sessions throughout classes. Post-production workshops, mixing tasks and exercises will be delivered during class time, you will then practise the skills learned in workshops to develop and complete this project.

You are tasked as a group to self manage, and delegate roles & responsibilities for each individual. Youâ€™re tasked with seeking feedback from your peers and facilitator on any work in progress (WIP) as well as acting/implementing upon this feedback both on the project and in your Learning Journal during studio workshops.

# Steps to Follow
1. Define your animation Project Team: One or more team members (depending on the length of animation chosen).
2. Define your role(s) and the audio assets you are responsible for sourcing/creating/recording/producing and timelines.
3. Download and utilise the project management software and files. Create a timeline (Gantt Chart) of the full animation project.
4. Youâ€™ll work together (or individually) and are each responsible for self-managing & self-organising the workflow, recording sessions, editing, SFX gathering, music composition or acquisition, casting of actors, mixing, communications, data management & session workflows.
5. Complete the tasks assigned to you in a timely manner and maintain a professional, clear communication with your audio team.
6. Seek WIP (work in progress) meetings with your team and facilitator and conduct review / quality assurance (QA) sessions to review. Animation soundtrack progress (make adjustments & revisions based on QA sessions).
7. Clearly document your work in your Learning Journal. Explain where the source audio came from and your involvement in the creation of any sounds / music
8. Print master in 5.1 and stereo (check deliverables).
9. Submit your project with 2 x 250 word project reflections, as outlined below:
