#Reflection #213/4 #Presentation

# Milestone Brief
This is your opportunity to look back over the trimester and ==consider what you have achieved and what you plan to do differently in the next studio.==
Your ==ability to reflect on and learn from your experience in this Unit, and to communicate this, is a key== part of progress as a creative media practitioner and is therefore part of your evaluation.
you will ==state which grade you believe you have achieved, by making direct reference to the work that you have completed== in ==comparison to the relevant Holistic Assessment Standards.==
concise presentation of all work completed within the Unit and ==compare your individual performance to the Learning Outcome Standards and Holistic Assessment Standards for Stage II Units==.
You need to ==articulate the sum total of your experience in the Studio Unit through reflection aligned with the 3Ps, and also describe your own aspirations and journey towards achieving these.==

## Steps to Follow
1.  Consolidate your experiences throughout the Unit, based on your Learning Journal entries.
2.  Compare your performance to the Holistic Assessment Standards.
3.  ==Articulate how you have met these Standards in evidence, citing specific examples.==
4. ==Document your key insights -== the things that you have learned about yourself that you will take forward into future Units to further hone your 3Ps.
5. Prepare a presentation of no more than 10 minutes in duration which summarises this information and acts as a rationale for a final grade.

# Notes
Decide on wether to use just your Learning Journal, or to use a Slideshow Presentation.
Leaning more towards a presentation as to not have to show Learning Journal - there might be too much going on there to sift through everything, as well as a proper presentation probably looks way better.

## Lab Tasks
Talk about the 3 x Lab Tasks that you had to do throughout the trimester.
	Reference you're own reflections of the tasks
	Show quick rendered examples

- (INSERT talking points on Lab Tasks)

## 213.1 - Game Audio
Go through the talking points on the project - keep talking to a minimum I think on this one - depending on how long the gameplay capture is, slice out parts that aren't showing much, & mainly use that to showcase your work.
Maybe touch on the most important points that you wrote about in your reflection.

[INSERT Gameplay Video Here]

## 213.2 - Animation S.D
You've already showcased a lot of the animation music - spend some of this time to maybe go through the SFX design that you did - breaking down how you did it - and **THE KEY POINTS** of your reflective work!

[INSERT Clips of audio design / mixing / home setup Foley studio]

- This project has a lot reflective work - talk only about struggles you've had with the mixing music stage - going back & forth - having to sum down like 150 tracks

## 213.3 - Film Sound 
This project has been a bit different for you - Location Recording for the 1st time, definitely learnt a lot with that - 1 major lesson, after discovering how powerful RX can be - the mentality of 'We can do that with Foley' *or* 'Fix it in post!' (RX), is low-key toxic AF, as 'future me' is not actually a super star - but rather the smelly, over-caffeinated, under-slept troll, and lets just say we should try make audio work for that guy as easy as possible.

But was also a good lesson in the importance of curating a team that works well together 

Show-case some of the foley - talk about how it can be a bit difficult trying to sus out sounds after - rather than just recording it right the first time around!

## In Context: Learning Outcomes & Holistic Grading


# Presentation Script
### Main Intro
- Want to start off by saying that I have more or less been at least a little late on a lot of things
	- From lab tasks to Project Handovers
- Started off on the wrong foot - issues w/ last trimesters unit - ended up with wrong mentality - always trying to catch up
- But I think the quality of work that I've done in a way makes up for it

## P1 - Game Audio
### Common Learning Outcomes
![[../../../../../../../../../3. Resources/DEPRICATED/ðŸ§¹OBSOLETE Resources/Media/CleanShot 2023-05-05 at 05.13.12.png|CleanShot 2023-05-05 at 05.13.12.png]]

### Learning Outcome 1
*Apply sound production methodologies to reinforce the narrative & audience impact in linear & nonlinear media.*
- [x] Develop & implement an appropriate sound design that reinforces the narrative of the game level
- [x] Demonstrate audio implementation techniques, making use of a minimum of 50 audio sources included throughout the level

- ==Make sure to say something about how can use *'Hold Right Click'* to rotate camera on axis - LIFE CHANGER==

	- Think that the music I made for the game is somewhat appropriate - though the campsite music is a little (or a lot) on the nose - still fits the aesthetic 
	- As well the main music I tried to keep just rhythmic - transferable to all different types of music / ambiences in the game world

	- Sound Design I think also fits quite well - initially tried doing more intricate S.D techniques etc, but just sounded 'overcooked' - went with a more pulled back rendition later - feels like it fits way better
	- Majority of 'overdone' S.D samples - were in FMOD stage - scrapped all of it when couldn't figure out FMOD implementation
	- Still bounce out audio & make a comparison slide

### Learning Outcome 3
*Apply location recording, Foley, ADR, sound design & mixing techniques in a media project*
- [x] Apply an appropriate mix across the level using the game engine or audio middleware mixer, with the application of in-game audio effects (demonstrating the use of both insert and aux send audio effects)

	- Firstly only really discovered the audio mixer right near end - already under big time pressure - some somethings still a little out of balance 
	- Was under the impression that shouldn't use the audio effects in engine as it can lead to some slow down - using unity on the laptop was already proving to be laggy at the best of times

- [x] Include the use of positional audio, distance attenuation and a reverb zone within a game environment
