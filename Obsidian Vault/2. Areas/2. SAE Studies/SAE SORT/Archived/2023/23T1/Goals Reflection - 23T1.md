# Mid-Trimester Reflection on Goals
### Week 7
I’ve really had my work cut out for me this trimester, from starting off this a little late due to some issues with my unit last trimester, to stupidly moving my whole personal note taking system to a new platform - obviously not a good idea right before trimester starts, as I’ve learnt there’s always going to be kinks to iron out when using a new system or platform, as well as being a bit of a perfectionist, I definitely wasted a bit of time trying to set everything up perfectly.
But to touch on starting this trimester late again, I think this kind of put me into a bit of a mental state of always trying to “catch up” which as most of us know is always harder than and more stressful than staying ahead of the curve.
At this point so far I still have Project 1 Due (1-2 weeks late) as well as having a lot of things like the Lab Tasks handed in late. I’ll have to to put in some hard work, catchup on everything, and get ahead of the curve. I’d definitely like to finally move on from having the pressure of being behind on me.
Also one major thing I learned this Trimester, which honestly Im surprised I hadn’t learnt this lesson earlier…

- TURN AUTO UPDATES OFF

My laptop updated a couple of weeks in, and from that broke a few things, Unity HUB & it’s Editor initially wouldn’t open, but once fixed, would crash all the time & for no apparent reason.

### Game & Film Audio 
Looking forward into the rest of my time at SAE I found out that this is basically the only time we get to work on Game Audio, and the last we really do on Foley / Film Audio. This is a little disappointing to me because Game Audio was definitely a pathway that I really wanted to explore - I find Sound Design super enjoyable and was super keen to dive deep into implementation for Game Engines, as well as possibly working with some of the Game students one day.
The games industry is one of the biggest and fastest growing industries in entertainment, that coupled with how complex game engines can be as well as how fast the technology in games audio is evolving, from 3D audio to Unreal procedural audio systems (MetaSounds), I don’t think 1/3 of a unit is enough of anything to give me the tools & skillset to let me break into the industry.
When thinking about how much SAE costs, I do find it a little upsetting to find out this is it, especially when we compare it to other things like Live Sound for example. Nothing against Live Sound itself, just seems the proportions are a little outbalanced, and I do understand that there’s a lot of variables to consider, like finding appropriate facilitators, student interest as well as numbers, etc. 
These are just my thoughts.
