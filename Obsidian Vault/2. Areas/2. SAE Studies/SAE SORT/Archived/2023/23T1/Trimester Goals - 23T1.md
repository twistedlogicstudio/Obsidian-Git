#QuarterlyGoals #SAE

# Do Outstanding Work
### Why?
The time studying at SAE is meaningful for 2 main reasons.

1. Learning the skills needed to propel you forward into the industry
2. Setting up the Proof of Work / Networking ground base, before breaking into the Industry

### Learning the Skills
While at SAE I’ll spend time honing my skills, and developing techniques needed in my future creative professional career. This time however is heavily weighing upon a self-appointed / self-encouraged learning, this in other words means that I only get out, what I put in. Thus to get the absolute most out of my time here, I must aim to do the best of my work, as well as push myself as far as possible.

### Proof of Work / Networking Ground Base
In conjunction to the previously outline point, the work that I create here can be used as a future portfolio, showing evidence that I can achieve outcomes of excellent quality. As part of this I should make sure to seek out and include feedback from different sources, such as peers, classmates and facilitators.

# How Do I Achieve This?
To achieve these goals, I need to implement **’Action Plans’** or different ways to ensure the success towards these goals. The first and arguably main point I need to practise is maintaining the:

## Growth Mindset
The Growth Mindset is a way of thinking where you continually seek to further your knowledge, your skillset & your capabilities.

### Cultivating a Growth Mindset
To start and strengthen the Growth Mindset I’ll need to recalibrate some of my thinking.

- Look at Challenges & Obstacles as **Opportunities**
- Give constructive criticism & promote the acceptance of criticism
- Encourage Persistence within myself
- Think of failure as part of the learning process
- Foster a positive attitude
- Keep pushing towards your goals

### Deadline Simulation
As well as cultivating a Growth Mindset, I should start looking at each and every one of my SAE deliverables as if it were a work project with a deadline.
This will begin the process of training myself to be diligent to meet deadlines and expectations. Having a strong understanding of the importance of deadlines, and how to properly task yourself to meet them is crucial to success in the future as a creative professional.
Whereas in a work environment, if I don’t meet such deadlines it could possibly mean the end of your job / not just a markdown on your grade.

### Breakdown Projects / Big Tasks into Smaller Chunks
Knowing yourself and how you work, from your best assets to your worst traits is important. I have identified the fact that I sometimes overwhelm myself when it comes to big projects  / tasks, not knowing where exactly to start.

Understanding this I should be active in trying to circumvent this issue, and the best way to do this is to break down the project. / big task, into smaller and smaller chunks.

Maybe a mind-map or a big drawing board could be a good way to do this!
