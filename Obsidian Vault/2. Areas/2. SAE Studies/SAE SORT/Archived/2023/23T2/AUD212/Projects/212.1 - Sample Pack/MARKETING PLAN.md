# Defining The Media Asset
## Tagline
*Describe your media asset & it's stylistic theme, concept or genre in one sentence*

#

## Name your Product & Company
### Company
- Wonky Waves

- Something derived from the word Waveform 
	- Wave Surface
	- Waveform Workshop
	- Wave Stream
	- Wave Flow
	- Wave Fission

- Something derived from the work Frequency
	- Frequency Shift
	- Freq. Sounds (Off of 'FREAK')
	- FREQ-E Sounds ?

### Product
Sample Pack will be based more off the 'Vibe' & 'Audio Aesthetic' rather than something like Genre. This fortunately gives us the opportunity to have a more broad spectrum of what we can use as part of the Pack, as a lot of Genres these days have Sub-Genres that overlap a lot of the same core vibes with each other.

**Examples:**
Genres like Hip-Hop, DnB, House, etc, all have Sub-Genres with the main core (sound) aesthetic is chill, eg - Lo-fi Hip-Hop, Liquid DnB, Lo-fi House.

The Core Aesthetic we're going for will be something under the vibe of:
- Chill Out
- Ambient 
- Relaxing or Studying
- Overall, nothing too aggressive 
-
