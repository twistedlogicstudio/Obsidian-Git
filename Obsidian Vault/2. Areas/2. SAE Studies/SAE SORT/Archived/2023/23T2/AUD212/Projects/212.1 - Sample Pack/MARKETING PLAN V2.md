**BLURB**
Youâ€™ll be nodding within 20 secs of the preview, does that say enough?!? If not letâ€™s entice you with some vocabulary to seal the deal.Â 

â€˜Parallelâ€™ is the go to pack for Drum & Bass, it fits Deep Drum & Bass, Jungle, Rolling and Liquid. The sound quality is top notch, the rhythms delicious and with a bunch of stems too this pack shines super bright. It hones in on low end movement, fills space with just the essentials and is truly effective from the word go.Â 

Drop these loops or stems in your tracks and watch them breathe new life with the smallest of effort.

### BLURB
Noisia Sample Pack Vol.2 is the final instalment from Noisia. We got so much excellent sample content from them that we had to split it into two separate volumes.

Inside, you'll find Noisia's incredible sounds waiting for you to use in your productions or analyse the production quality of the samples created by one of Drum & Bass and Bass Music's most significant acts.

Notes from Noisia:

We've done something we've never done before. We put together a Noisia sample pack. These samples span more than 20 years of making sounds. It's crazy for us to share all this material because it comes from unfinished Noisia songs. But, on the other hand, many of them are so good we wish we'd used them. But because Noisia is coming to an end, now is the time to share these samples. As you would probably expect, it consists of many bass, drums, and other elements, from modular complexities to funny accidents to strange atmospheric textures. We hope these sounds inspire you to create.

### NOTES 
Noisia transcends a lot of different styles of drum & bass, let alone genres. But looking at the artwork, with a bit of knowledge behind their discography - My mind definitely draws more towards their heavier Neurobass style music.

	- Heavy Reese Bass sounds 
	- Big distorted / metallic synths 
	- Super punchy, snappy drum samples - loops (Borderline over-compressed)
	- Dark audio tones - from cinematic style SFX, to dark & distorted synth melodies

- Definitely like the vibe & the sound of this stuff - would be good to learn more about how to make some of these sounds.
