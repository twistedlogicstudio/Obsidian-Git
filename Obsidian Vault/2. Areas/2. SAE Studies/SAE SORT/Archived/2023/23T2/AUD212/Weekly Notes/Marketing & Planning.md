## Use Facebook Marketing

- Use coupon codes / discounts to incentivise people to buy now instead of thinking about it later
- Have ways to data mine - if you have the data of when people click through which pages, you can know who to re-target:
	- *eg* - If you have someone that clicks add to cart, but doesn't checkout - you can re-target them to try and finally make the purchase.
	- What ways you do this depends on your creativity & how aggressive you want to be with your sales & marketing

### Campaign
- He uses the conversion campaign - he pretty much leaves campaign budget optimisation on
- Defining the audience - set the daily budget
	- Selecting the conversion event - what you want to happen when people see your ad, the end result of the advertisement, *eg:*
		- If you just want people to see it - view content / if you want people to purchase the product - purchase, etc.
	- **Make sure to confirm & test any events prior to making the campaign**
- Select the countries you want to target - think about location / age / things that'll affect the demographic to purchase your product.
- Add tags - target expansion - helps to target the ideal customer
- Upload marketing material - add in marketing text & shit
- Add in the Link
- *Calls to Action:*
