## 2. Design Synthesis Referencing Program Material
Explore newly introduced synthesis concepts. Use reference material to imitate and create synthesis patches.

*Here are some Stems that have the MIDI for the synthesisers played in. Use you knowledge of synthesis to recreate the synth sounds, referencing the original (in session).*

## 3. Create A Sample Based Instrument Using Synthesis
Program sounds using hardware synthesisers and then uses sampling tools to recreate the synthesiser patch within a sampler.

Use resources from theÂ [Sampling](https://sites.google.com/sae.edu/aud212unitsite/sessions/sampling?authuser=0)Â class to help you.
