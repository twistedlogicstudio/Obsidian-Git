## KONTAKT

### Prepping the Audio for New KONTAKT instrument

* Duplicate playlist first - so you have a backup (Pro Tools)

- Peak Normalise clips ~ -3dbFS (audiosuite)
  - *cmd + click ~ option in menu to add it to the top*

- Noise Reduction: `RX (audiosuite)`
  - *RX Connect: sends to RX, instead of using the plugin editor*
  - We do noise reduction because the (super-low, inaudible noise) stacks ontop of itself when playing multiple samples / notes together ~ eg. as a chord
  - **Good Practise:** to record 5 - 10 secs of *nothing* at start to get a good noise profile


*  **SIDEBAR:** Pro Tools Settings - adjust handle length
 

- Tune Samples: `Melodyne`

- Dynamic EQing ~ *removing the dirty air*


* **SIDEBAR:** Strip Silence ~ *cmd + U / cmd + Undress ;)*
 
* See if there's a way to Batch Rename in Pro Tools 
 - Leave trim
 - Edit `Numbering` section
 - Make sure to tick `Timeline Order`
 

* Loading into KONTAKT
*in Pro Tools*
- make new instrument track
- Go to folder w/ audio files - drag & drop
- Go through process of linking sample to corresponding key (piano)
- Use `Automap` - see attached doc for setting up the Automap

**REMEMBER:** - when saving, remember to tick: 
  - Patch & Samples
  - Monolith = N.I's version of zip file




## KONTAKT Instrument Ideas
* Rhodes Piano
  - Could be cool to sample the Rhodes Piano, mangle it - then make it into an instrument / could be a cool 'distopian' version or something. If we decide to go down into a theme like that.
  
* Foley Drums
  - Record a bunch of Foley samples & process them like different parts of a drum kit | percussion / then make a cool - different sounding drumpad, kit, etc.
  
  **Kit Ideas**
  - Warehouse | Industrial 
  - Toystore | Mall | 
  - Kitchen | House | Garage
