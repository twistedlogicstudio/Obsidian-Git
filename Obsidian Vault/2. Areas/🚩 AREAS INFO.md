# Areas Section: Mentality 
Areas are for the Roles or Responsibilities in your life which have an ongoing standard or maintenance.Â 
Areas also never get completed, theyâ€™re like the â€˜ongoing side questâ€™ in games that you continually work on.

>[!INFO] THE THING TO REMEMBER
>- Theyâ€™re important & relevant on an _ONGOING_ basis. Theyâ€™re important right now, but different to Projects as theyâ€™re just as important in the future as well.
>- Theyâ€™re not as _ACTIONABLE_ as projects are but still require attention.

*Examples:*

### Finances
You might need to keep on top of your Taxes, or Debt - Constantly tracking where your money goes ect.

### Health
You might need to track things like Diet or Exercise habits

### Relationships
Things like gift ideas for friends & other important things for family, etc.

# Summary
So even though you might not be able to â€˜completeâ€™ or â€˜check offâ€™ certain things in Areas, theyâ€™re still important to track ideas / dreams & wishes over time for each area.
