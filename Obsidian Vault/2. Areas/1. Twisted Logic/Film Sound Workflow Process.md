# Timeline & Schedule
The main points being, that without a proper ‘picture lock’ we can end up wasting a lot of time - recording & editing audio for things that end up being cut.

- We also need to ensure that there’s a realistic expectation of timelines for deliverables

### *Reference*

- Given enough time ideas can be properly fleshed out & built upon.

### Remember:
The process doesn’t really work in the way of: **BRIEF | REC | DONE** 
We also need to account for the ‘back-n-forth’ communication of ideas, feedback & work.

At the end of the day, it’s your creative baby. It’s our job to (as best as possible) aid in achieving that vision. This unfortunately cannot be done without the proper time & communication, to let ideas flourish.

# The Working Process
![[../../4. Archives/Media/Images/Audio-work timeline.jpg|Audio-work timeline.jpg]]

## 1. Initiation & Project Briefing
Group meets to outline Deliverables, Expectations, Themes, Genres, Styles, Creative Direction & anything else that might be important to the project. Most important part of this is to get a clear (as possible):

- outline & understanding of what the **_Project Deliverables_** are, and what is _expected of you._ 

## 2. Researching & Planning
Research prior (and during) the project can help to inform creative ideas. Even just a basic Brainstorm can help to form a strong direction, which at the early stages can streamline the Project Kick-off, helping to build momentum early. 

- Here the team should discuss & plan things like: Team Roles / a basic Project Timeline / Milestones & Goals.

## 3. Asset Collection
The team breaks off into their roles & starts to collect assets (audio) that might be useful for the Project. Assets can be anything from: Items & Materials that’ll be useful for Foley Recording days / Recording of Ambiences & Atmospheres / Sample Digging / Playlist Building (Musical References), etc.

- An important detail to remember is that when collecting assets, delegating roles & tasks can be a good way to maximise time efficiency - mitigating crossover & team members accidentally doubling up.

## 4. The Work / Review Cycle
### Work:
Using the research done & utilising the assets collected (as a group) start building the production up.

*Tasks can be divvied up or worked on together.*

### Review:
As work continues & milestones are hit - continue to liaise with both audio team & other relevant members. Using feedback to inform changes moving forward.

## 5. Consolidation & Deliverable Submission
