# Long Term

## Become Someone Who Gets Things Done
You’re turning 29 this year, and you still do some things that are seriously holding yourself back. 

Now is the time to really take a good look at yourself and decide the path you want to go down, because if you keep doing the same things you’ve been doing, you’re going to end up nowhere in life.

You have a great talent in audio, you just need to start putting things into motion, get things done & to change your mindset to an open one.

### Strive to be your best

# 2023 Goals For The Year

# Finances & Time Management
You’re biggest weaknesses are all tied into your Time Management & how you manage your Finances.

So for the rest of this year the main goal is to smash through your bad habits & to become a gun with managing your money & your time.

## Monthly / June
Aus Study should be going through this month - so at least you’ll have an actual income, instead of relying on mum.

Before the end of this month I need to have completed:

### 1. Personal Finances Spreadsheet
This is to have everything that takes money OUT of your account recorded & accounted for - so you can properly budget each week - with a focus on paying back mum for borrowed rent & bills

### 2. **Accounted Foe All Money Owing / Plan For Paying It Back**
You’ve had this mentality for so long it’s easy to forget & lose track of all the money you’ve borrowed - & who you still owe

- YOU DONT WANT THE REP OF NOT PAYING PEOPLE BACK

So make a list & outline all of the money you owe - and draw up a basic plan as to how you’re going to pay people back

### 3. **Finish CV / Apply For Jobs / Made Steps In Freelance**
You need ot find good & consistent work, as well as seriously getting onto clearing your debt. You’re almost 30 and you literally have no savings, no money & no job opportunities. SORT IT OUT

- - -
# Health

## Get Back into the Gym / Bodybuilding
Get back to your Bodybuilding Routine 
5x days / week - training hard / eating well
Work towards getting that rig back
By end of year, try hit goal weight: 80kg.

You’ve really let yourself go the last couple of years & it’s shown. Exercise & the gym is good for your body & your mental health so make sure that you get back into the routine of gyming everyday.

### **REMEMBER:**
Starting back up after such a long time is going to be hard - so be realistic.

Start off light & slow - minimum 30 mins (THATS IT) if you’re ready to bail, then bail - just make sure that you’re consistent.

### **CONSISTENCY IS KEY:**
Just make sure that you’re going at least 3x days / week - once you start getting the hang of it all again, then you can ramp it up. Just make sure that you’re sticking to it & not dropping off again like you have been lately.

# Career
## Find Work / Get Paid in Audio
- Have a Freelance job listing up / Have finshed at least 2x paid audio jobs

### Stretch Goal
Find a job in audio, preferably in a studio, or have some things up for sale - Sample Packs / Lessons

- FInish some passion projects 

- Finish some of the film projects people asked you for help on

## Kick Off Freelancing
Goals for June - These tasks need to be completed:

### FINISH CV / RESUME
Apply for the mining job as well

### FREELANCING
Setup Fiver - or something of the sort to try & get some possible freelancing work kicking off

### FILM
Get onto the film projects you’ve been putting off for this whole time - remember this’ll be really good for your portfolio - just make sure that you’re doing things within your means!

# Wealth
## Start Eliminating your Debt
By end of the year have 10% of overall debt paid off 

### AFTER FINANCES SPREADSHEET IS DONE:
Fill out the rest of this goal 
Have a consistent habit of paying off debt & not acumilating more

### NEED TO BE COMPLETED BY END OF JUNE:

- Pay off - get TTP going again [get a check on when you’ll be getting your license back again]
- Make sure to have some sort of income stream - ideally Centrelink - if things need documents / fails - GET ONTO IT ASAP
- Stop ordering Uber Eats, cook more - make sure to be wise about every $ you spend

- - -
# Relationships
## Reconnect / Be Present w/ People
Start forming the habit of better communication - don’t end up with 100 messages each day that you havent replied to / banked up.

### Keep your finger on the pulse 
- Be more present & reconnect with people & friends, open the lines of communication - plan outings & catchups

Reach out to people for different things!

### CLEAR MESSAGES / GET BACK TO EVERYONE

You’ve been seriously so bad the last year / 2 years with maintaining your relationships - make sure to get back into the habit of just texting people back straight away.

Clear your messages & commit to the things you plan to do with people  - it’ll be hard to start off with, but remember CONSISTENCY is KEY - just keep at it & it’ll eventually become a habit

- - -
# Growth
## Consistent Learning
Get into & keep consistent habits of learning new skills & refining your current ones.
Make sure to work on your audio skillsets everyday - 1% everyday will get you further than cramming 
commit to finishing LinkedIN Learning Resources

### WORK TOWARDS A FUTURE YOU WANT

Remember the things you value, the future you want for yourself - & make sure that you’re doing things constantly & consistently, that inch you closer to these visions

Make sure to do passion projects like - ‘Mix-In-a-Day’ etc.

Timed Challenges for yourself & everything 

- When doing these little things, make sure to try & document everything, can put it up on your portfolio blog - & hopefully can one day use it as leverage for work in audio
