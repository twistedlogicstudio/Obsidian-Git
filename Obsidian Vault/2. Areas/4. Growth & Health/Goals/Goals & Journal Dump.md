# Ideas Dump for a Journal or Goals Project

## NOTE 1.
- - -
I've written about this and covered it a lot over the past, where I really need to learn how to sit down and focus on finishing my shit. 

And recently I think I need to figure out how to manage my tasks better, as well as figuring out a way to better stay on these tasks.

## SOME SPITBALLING
- - -
1. ROUTINE & SLEEP!

   * I need to get a better sleeping routine, let alone routine in general.
   
   * Routine Block weekly tasks - COMMIT
     - If you commit to a routine of actually doing the things you need to do, you'll set yourself up to be a lot more committed
     - *Eg:* BINS! / Groceries / Budget / 
     * **WEEKLY NOTES:** Setup a *'Weekly Budget'* in Obsidian - Using Periodic Notes plugin / Also include a *'Weekly Reflection / Journal'*
       - So instead of something like this - it's dumped weekly: That way you can track these things week-to-week
       - Maybe a cool inclusion to the *Weekly Note* are the Unclutter Notes / Cool things & Cool websites or videos to check out or something
       - Another possibly good inclusion for the 'Weekly Notes' could be a **Habit Tracker** - how this would be used & implemented would have to be figured out.


### Routine & Sleep Notes
Maybe for financing, splitting the amount that monthly bills are into weekly chunks & moving it into a BANK account thats not app-facing (to stop myself continually moving it back out). Once bills come through - transfer it out, pay the bills, etc.

Put monotonous tasks into Apple Reminders (maybe with a start & deadline date) so that you're reminded on certain days & again on the deadline? (double check this).
Tasks like:
- BINS OUT
- LAUNDRY
- CLEAN ROOM / HOUSE

Maybe spend a little time - (block out the time chunks to not fall into a time sink) - and figure out how you might *in the near future* implement a **Habit Tracker**

2. DISTRACTIONS!

   * I need a better way of not getting distracted / as well as staying on tasks.
   
   * Music instead of watching movies / YT is probably going to be a lot more beneficial for actually being productive
     - So doesn't have to be *all-or-nothing* / keep the most important tasks that *NEED* to be done - during a time that you don't watch anything in the background.
     - Where other things that still needs to be done, but aren't as dire / eg. Finances / Weekly Task Scheduling / etc. have these tasks saved for the end of the night, where you can sit down and enjoy a movie or something while you do these tasks
   
   * Maybe go somewhere else less distracting!
     - Commit to going to a coffee shop / SAE / or other places to do your work
     - This will engrain a 'work' mindset when you get there so you can kick it off by actually sitting down and working
     
   * STOP CHECKING TORRENTS / APPS / SOCIALS
     - Maybe get app blockers to block things off
     - For always checking torrents - once you finally setup the Homelab, have the downloading / torrenting to be done *right onto the server:*  this way you can forget about checking it all the time, as well as worrying about disk space on yout laptop.

   * Use a **POMODORO Timer!**
     - Properly & consistently use a Pomodoro Timer especially when trying to kick off things at the start. 
     - The start is usually the hardest part - so just try & bust out 1 / 2 / 3 cycles of the Pomodoro Timer, see if that gets things rolling or not.


### Distractions Notes
So far from using the Doom Emacs to actually sit down and write the notes, seems to actually be useful in generally just focusing on getting the notes down on paper. 

Not consistantly worrying about the exact formatting & styles, definitely has me focusing on the task at hand better.

* A big point of contentionn though is that I need to better block **IMPORTANT** tasks. 
  - As I constantly keep putting off *actually* important tasks for 'busy work.'
