Hey hun, I mean firstly sorry for dropping off the grid a bit there, have recorded & deleted & recorded again a video I was going to send you, but ended up just pussying out anyways lol. 

You haven't been bugging or pestering :( But I've been struggling a bit lately - mentally, emotionally, etc. but also low key drowning a bit with the projects I got going at the moment. Haven't wanted to interact with anyone for a bit, but then would try force myself to which I feel like just ends up making it low key a little worse :\ so I think I just ended up going full hermit haha (literally have left the house twice in like the last 2 months)

But think I pretty much hit rock bottom 

This would have been low key kinda perfect I think - jamie & davo just went to bali 
so have had the house to myself, so was thinking I'd finally sit down, rest & reset... but Mum was coming round literally everyday, projects were going tits up, etc etc.

But I've been speaking with Mum about it and some things, and we said that maybe I just need to basically do what you did, and try a move, fresh start and all. So once I've paid off a little more of my debts and shit
