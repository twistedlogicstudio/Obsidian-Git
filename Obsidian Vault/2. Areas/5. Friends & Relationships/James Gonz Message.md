Hey dude, sorry for the complete absence for so long!
Honestly nothing against you at all, I've more or less been of socials for the longest time now, and whenever I do manage to go on, I'm backed up with so many missed messages etc, that I get overwhelmed lol.

So dw, you and everyone else has been basically under the same idea. So I've been trying to (slowly) get back to everyone, clear the air and all.

And if you've been texting me at all, I didn't have a phone for a good stint (left it in an Uber, and it ended up in Sri Lanka / tracked it with 'Find My iPhone' the whole way jahah)

But here's my number, it's still definitely the easiest way to get a hold of me.

0416570172

If you still need some help with Tech shit, or if you need me to sus out some pirate programs, let me know and I'll do it for cheap, if I'm not bogged down with projects & work!

Either way, hope you're doing well man!
