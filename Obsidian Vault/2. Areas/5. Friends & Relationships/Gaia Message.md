Hey Jackass!

So firstly I want to say sorry! Sorry for not replying or getting back to for so long :( not trying to ignore you or anything like that, I really hope you wern't thinking that!

I've been struggling, mentally & emotionally a bit lately. With so much work, uni and my own projects going on all at once, I think I ended up over working myself to the point I basically fully burnt out, which ended with me more or less having a mental breakdown and cutting off communication with anyone outside of work for like 5-6 months.

But I've been working on it, and think I've come out the otherside.

But still doesnt change the fact I've been absent for so long. I didn't even properly congratulate you on finishing your yoga course and everything! So congrats! I'm proud of you :) and am so glad you chased down your dreams

I have a couple photos of us pinned up in my room so have been thinking of you a lot lately, and I can't believe that it's been like 5 years :( still miss you often, but hope you're doing well!

I also have a bit of a favour to ask...

I stupidly managed to accidentally delete pretty much all of my documents and photos. I still have a couple of us in a photo album, but if you still have any of us tucked away somewhere I'd love if you could send them through, I'd hate to have lost pretty much all of them :(

Also I've been thinking about moving to Sydney to finish off the last year or so of Uni, so if you have any tips or tricks for Sydney let me know, or if you're ever thinking about popping back into Aus for a holiday definitely give me a holla!

Anyways, hope you're doing well! Miss you always :)
