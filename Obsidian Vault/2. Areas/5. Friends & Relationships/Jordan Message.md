Hey dude!

Firstly sorry for ending up on a fully communication breakdown :( 
In all honesty I've been struggling a bit mentally lately, and for the longest time I thinkI was just straight up avoiding any human contact period...

But I've been working on it, and I think I'm more or less out the other side
