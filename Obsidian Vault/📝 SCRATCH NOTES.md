## Cloud Computing ~ Microsoft Azure

They have a free account with what looks like quite a bit of free services
- Definitely need to look into this further

They also have a <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">'Pay As You Go'</mark> pricing scheme
Not sure exactly how good / bad the actual pricing is ~ but with all the services on offer
- DEFINITELY need to check it all out

- OKAY... After trying for the last like 40 mins, going ROUUND & ROUND ~ them signing me
- In & out - maybe it's not the best service after all... Seems unnecessarily complicated

ALSO: ~ Apparently I'm not eligible for a free Azure Account...???


## ChatGPT / OpenAI ~ Into your workflow

Remember:/ The Future is here, don't get lost behind, make sure to start incorporating AI technology
into your studies & workflow as much as possible.

Everyone seems to be more or less charging a price for these platforms now, so definitely check
against your finances, and see what you can budget it

- Would also be worth it to spend a little time and see if you can manage to find somewhere to use ChatGPT where you don't need to continually guy tokens

- Should start looking at how to backup everything using Git & GitHUB
- Also need to look into how viable just using GitHUB as a sudo notes system is ~ Seems like it would be a good way to have your notes everywhere, as well as being the best backup protocol

```Generate a chilling and ominous album cover depicting a scene inspired by the following themes: 'Haunted Forest,' 'Abandoned Asylum,' and 'Eldritch Horrors.' The image should evoke a sense of terror and unease, utilizing dark and eerie colors to create a foreboding atmosphere. Ensure that the generated artwork is rich in detail, with intricate elements that hint at otherworldly entities and sinister shadows. Let the viewer feel as though they're stepping into a Lovecraftian nightmare, where the lines between reality and the supernatural are blurred. Embrace the macabre and the arcane, and make this album cover a visual representation of the horrors that lie just beyond our perception.
