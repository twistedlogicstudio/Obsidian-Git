# The Plan
This project is to re-do the network cabling throughout the house. This in essence is just replacing the houses old telephone cables with more future-proof Cat6A network cables. 

>To minimise the amount of drilling & work to the actual house & structure, i'll just be utilising the pathways that were used for the old & obsolete cables.

### The spots include:
- 2x for the lounge
	- 1x old telephone cable - located near the door 
	- 1x old coaxial cable located on far long wall 
- 1x front lounge room
	- this will be where the router runs cable to a network switch
- 1x spare room
- 1x guest bedroom - i'm pretty sure, will need to double check this one

## Notes & Thoughts
Figure out the best way to route cables in & out of the Linen Closet

### BRidge mode
When reworking the home network - figure out how to setup the second router. Probably setup in *'Bridge Mode'* - can test run before wiring the internet in. If it works, can start setting up Homelab unit properly.
