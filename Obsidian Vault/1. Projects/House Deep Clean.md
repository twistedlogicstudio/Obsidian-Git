## Notes & Thoughts
### Remember
- Don't worry too much about organising all of the Kitchen Cupboards. That job is **WAY** too big to get that + everything else done by the time Davo & Jamie get back

### Maybe
- Think about what to do with the backyard / frontyard - probably left for a future project, but good to think about & plan now / something to chip away at.
-  Block out some ideas for cleaning out the attic - even sorting it out. Could be a good place for storing some things. Plus is you're going to be up there, could be worth your time thinking about how to clean / clear it all up.
	- Don't take this idea too seriously - it'll probably be a massive job / so don't waste time you don't have to.
