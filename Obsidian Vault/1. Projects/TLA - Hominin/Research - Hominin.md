>[!notes]

- Layer real / analogue sounding music with synths & foley or real sounds - *instead of a driving bassline - use the 'beating' of the helicopter*
- Have it like the blending of both organic & synthetic sounds
	- Or even synth tones & layers w/ organic rhythmic percussion & drums

For the music - definitely reference the GDC - Sounds of Star Wars video - definitely a lot of good ideas I can use. [GDC - The sounds of Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2VW2hk0jGc)

- Counterpoint - something to look into & possibly use - mentioned in second 1/2 of talk

# Star Wars Sound Design
## Notes from Ben Burtt

[Ben Burtt - NPR Interview](https://www.npr.org/2010/12/12/131968222/-the-sounds-of-star-wars-now-at-fans-fingertips)

>[!quote] Keep it Realistic
>"He wanted his universe to sound real, kind of used -- ordinary, you might say, very natural," the author says. "So his suggestion was, 'Well, don't go to your synthesizers first and generate echoing electronic tones for me, but rather, go out into the real world with your tape recorder and record motors and animals and bring back familiar sounds, which we can modify into something otherworldly.'"

>[!note] Darth Vader Sound
>"The script described Vader as wearing some kind of life-support suit that had machinery to keep him alive," Burtt says. So the designer famously went to a local dive shop to see what he could find.
>
>"I just asked if I could go in the back room and record different scuba masks and regulators and things," he recalls. "I just spent an hour or so back there, trying out the different breathing apparatuses that were laying around. And ultimately that -- which was me breathing -- once brought back to the studio where it was slowed down a little bit, became the breathing of Darth Vader."

### Spitballing
For the 'Robotic / Droid' dialogue sounds - a good way I think we could achieve that effect is by using a frequency shifter - *Reference B1 Battle Droid*

Obviously some bit crushing - layering with some machine sounds - scuba effect like Darth Vader - maybe even layer some synth sounds.

For something that sounds like General Grievous - use a Phaser - drop the pitch - could even layer with some machine sounds again - think, something *airy / gassy*

## Vehicles
### Speeder Bike
Sound of an Speeder Bike was achieved by mixing together the recorded sounds of a P-5 Mustang airplane, a P-38 Lockheed Interceptor.

### Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder
The whoosh of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder was achieved by recording the roar the Los Angeles Harbour Freeway through a vacuum-cleaner pipe.

- *This actually would be a sick sound byte*


### Imperial Walkers
The sound of the Imperial Walkers were created by modifying the sound of a machinist's punch press. Added to this for complexity, were the sounds of bicycle chains being dropped on concrete.
