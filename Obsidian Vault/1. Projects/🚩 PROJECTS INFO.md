# Project Section: Mentality
Projects should be thought of as:

> *Any outcome that you’re actively committed to, that’ll take multiple working sessions to complete or achieve*

The main 2 fundamentals for Projects:
- They have an **OUTCOME** or a **GOAL** that you want or needs to be achieved
- They have a deadline / timeframe that it needs to be completed within

>[!NOTE] **Projects are Action Orientated**
>Projects are ***Important*** because they’re ***ACTIONABLE,*** right now.
