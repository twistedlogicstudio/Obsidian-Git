## Rack Ideas 
### Mid | Side OTT
A two-chain rack, with a 100% Mid utility in one chain, and a 100% Side utility in the other. To change a utility to mid/side mode, right click on the "Width" knob (nice hidden feature). Then each chain has an OTT. I have macros for:

- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Time</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Amount</mark>
- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Mid</mark>
- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Unlink </mark> - This is mapped to the attack/release times for the three bands in the Side OTT, and it adds about 20ms to each attack and 200ms to each release) - this unlinks the Mid and Side times, adding a bit more stereo width.
### Phase Silencer
This is another two chain rack. Chain A has a utility, with the phase inverted. Chain B has nothing. When you put sound into this, you get nothing but silence, because the phase of the two chains is opposite. **However,** you can put effects into Chain B and start getting bizarre results. Basically, the only audio output by this rack is the _difference_ between Chain A and Chain B, in this case the change an effect is making. So, the original signal doesn't come through, just whatever small changes the effect has.

- Apparently this was showcased on a Mr. Bill livestream ~ might be worth finding and looking into
### Phat Rack
A simple rack aimed at making things sound super PHAT. Probably best if aimed more for Drums & Bass sounds, but maybe try and implement functionality enough for Synths as well
### 808X10
A simpler rack aimed at making simple 808 samples / instruments sound interesting or different




### Utility Plus
### Randomiser
