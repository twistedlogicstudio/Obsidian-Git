#Shortcuts #Ideas
- - -
# 🧠 Brain Dump
- Just a simple shortcut to quickly jot down ideas - whatever comes to you / should just be a quick text idea to jot something down - with maybe a picture after if necessary
	- ***Remember this - Shortcut*** - Maybe try re-work this into using Obsidian

> For an Automation thing you could have it where you automatically check through your weekly dumps / asking for a summary - or most useful information - before getting moved into an archive folder? 
> 
> This would save a bit on clutter with folders & such - & force you to maybe weed out only the most crucial / best info

# ⛳️ Goals / Reflections
- Have a weekly Reflections things setup - Monthly review or something / Just start actively planning & tracking how you are working towards your goals
- Without any direction, you’ll be going nowhere REAL QUICK
- Maybe have it similar to the current ‘remember this’ where each time (that day) you hit the shortcut button - you add to that days note - can keep things minimal & simple / until you actually need to sit down properly to hash out your thoughts

> For an Automation thing you could definitely have something setup where each week - you have the a roundup reflection / gather your thoughts & have a bit of a plan for the coming week
> 
> REMEMBER - stop caring about what people think of you. Do whatever you have to do, to get shit done.
