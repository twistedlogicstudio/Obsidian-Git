# WEEKLY JOURNAL • REFLECTION
>[!info] Journaling & reflection
> The main thing to remember for this section: CONSISTENCY - Don't worry about writing a whole bunch of shit, just focus on getting some ideas & thoughts down, even if it's just some dot points. 
>
> Main idea is to build that habit.
## NOTES
### TASK LIST • ALL AREAS
I think I've written this down a couple of times now, but I should setup a seperate ***TASK LIST*** note for each of the different areas (that are mentioned in here)

That way I can just link to them in here - keeping things a little less cluttered.
