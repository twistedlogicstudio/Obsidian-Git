# WEEKLY JOURNAL â€¢ REFLECTION
>[!info] Journaling & reflection
> The main thing to remember for this section: CONSISTENCY - Don't worry about writing a whole bunch of shit, just focus on getting some ideas & thoughts down, even if it's just some dot points. 
>
> Main idea is to build that habit.

## How are you *feeling* this week?

- Feeling a bit better than the week before -  finally got on the phone to Catie / spoke all night & for way too long, instead of doing SAE work - but was actually really good / spoke about a lot of good shit, etc. Definitely feel a lot more emotionally refreshed afterwards.

## How productive have you been with your work this week?

- Definitely been way more distracted & with SAE kicking off again, have been messing about just doing *busy work* ... need a better way to make sure that I stay on task.

- The mini notebook is actually kinda helpful - will be good idea to try and keep it on the person | see if you can keep using it / see if it ends up staying useful

## Notable ideas for next week?

- You still need to run through all of your [[1. SAE 23T3 Prep|1. SAE 23T3 Prep]] | *Hurry Up & FINISH IT*
- You need to go through & finish the written work for WK1 & WK2 - as well as P1 

- Need to *HURRY UP & FINISH* your resume / CV - send it through to Mum ASAP

- Pitch Catie that  idea: 
	- Keeping each other accountable for their own projects
	- If we try and do it right - once things scale up, there'll already be a proper system in place | ready to go

 >[!quote] When watching doco: 'Hacktivist' he talks about how, they don't have to be working on the same project | the act of talking & asking about each others projects - keeps them learning & growing


- You need to plan out the Pitch for Quincy - make it into a project & start brainstorming & planning it out
- Start hashing out the *Teaching* ideas

- Chase up Catie about teaching her friend - as above, start building teaching docs.

## In Class

On Wednesday - we got into labs / recording rooms ~ kicked off some of the recording shit, but because the control room isn't fully setup yet we couldn't properly get things setup for recording the Foley stuff. We did setup with the guitar & recorded a whole bunch of stuff. Was surprisingly good, and with the horror theme managed to get a whole bunch of super dope sounds, etc.

For the session, we did come up with the ideas super quick though ideally we should have run through and discussed these things earlier.

Plus for the session, we maybe could have even structured it in a way that we can record both the guitar & the foley stuff at the same time. I'm thinking this because while recording if did feel like we were just sitting in the control room, kind of just doing nothing.
	- Now with hindsight, we could have talked over / gone through the documentation or something.

Now what we should do is, finish the documentation, start planning out the other things needed for the project ~ as well as plan out the next recording days.

### Ideas for Recording Sessions
- Foley / Random Items ~ record them in the same way as we did with the Guitar.
	- 1x channel - raw / no FX & unprocessed
	- 1x channel - running through the pedal board first - playing with the FX parameters.

>[!quote] If enough of the original Foley samples have been recorded, we can still capture more samples with the FX by just recording the FX channel instead of both.

## Weekly Reflection

Now I think, moving forward, we need to go through and plan out the rest of the project - as there's not that much time left, plus there's a lot of shit still to do.
### So what's the plan?
So I think we need to plan out & divide up the different tasks / research ~ or like we said everyone do a little bit & then come together to consolidate.

Brainstorm some ideas for the cover art, etc, and all that shit. A good & easy way to probably do things is to use different AI tools to get different jobs done ~ cover art / descriptions / etc.

Brainstorm the next session ~ [[../../1. Projects/ðŸ”Š AUD212/212 - Projects/P1 - Recording Artist/212.1 â€¢ Recording Session 2|212.1 â€¢ Recording Session 2]]
