Make a spreadsheet to keep a contacts list of networking & industry contacts.
For now just dump all contacts & info in here, but maybe start an 'Apple Numbers' document (their version of a spreadsheet app) and start putting it into there - be a good way to learn the program as well.

Hit up Peter (Packard?) for his contact - tell him you'd love to keep in contact, and that you're open for helping with anything that pops up.
