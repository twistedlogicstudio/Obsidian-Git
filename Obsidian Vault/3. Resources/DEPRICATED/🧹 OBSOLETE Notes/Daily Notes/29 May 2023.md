## SAE Todo
## **In Class Activity: Week 1**

- Find a song that you like, that has a synthesized sound in it.
- Listen critically, what characteristics does the sound have?

- What is the sound, a bass? Lead? Ambient sound? Chord?
- Is it bright? Dull? What kind of waveform might be used for it?
- Does filtering play a part in the sound?
- Is there lots of movement in the sound, or is it fairly static?
- Is the sound quick (staccato) or long (legato)?
- What effects are on the sound? Distortion? Delay? Reverb? Unison or chorus?

- Have a go at re-creating the sound in Ableton using any of the synths there.
- Document this in your Professional Development page (Project 3) under the AUD212 section of your learning journal. Include:

- The characteristics of the sound you identified;
- A link to the song itâ€™s from;
- A summary of your process for recreating it in Ableton, including a screenshot; and
- A bounced example of your sound for comparison.
