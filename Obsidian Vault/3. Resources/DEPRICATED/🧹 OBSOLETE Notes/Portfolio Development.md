# Goal
Have an online Portfolio in the form of a website, and to develop the website myself to have complete creative control over the look & style, as well as well as saving a bit of money only paying for the domain name instead of a whole platform like [Squarespace.](https://www.squarespace.com) 

By working towards this goal I’ll be able to learn some coding (mainly HTML, CSS & Javascript) diversifying my skillset, as well as learning more that goes into web development.
