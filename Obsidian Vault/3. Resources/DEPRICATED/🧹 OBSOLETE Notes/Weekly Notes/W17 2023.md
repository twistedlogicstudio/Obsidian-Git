# Personal Goals
## Make Me & Mum Proud
## Why?
Mum has fought tooth and nail her whole life, a lot of it for me, and I cannot love her enough for it. So the absolute least I could do is make her proud, and to make her proud is to see me succeed. She’s always supported me doing whatever it is I wanted to do, from Personal Training, to anything else. With this being the career I finally want to do, she still supports me all the time, and even after continuously refusing, she still offers, all the time. SO;

- **Make your Mumma *PROUD* and crush it with your studies!**

## How?
To keep this on top of your mind, to always make sure that you’re remembering the fight mum has done for you, put a young photo of her on your working desk, maybe also make it your phone background or something especially for study / work periods.
