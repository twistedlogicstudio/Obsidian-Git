# D&D ~ Baldurs Gate 3 

>[!info] Might be a cool idea to actually plan out a proper playthrough?
> Nothing too extensive - just a basic idea of what the playthrough would be / characters / partylineup etc.

## NOTES

* Having the stylised clothes for the characters, with the powers (things like misty step) low-key kind of ruins a bit of the fun.
  
  - I think it's cause it makes things a little too easy.
  
  
### Playthrough Ideas

**Proper Classic - Tactiscian**
- No mods / just a vanilla playthrough on Tact Difficulty.
- This will be a proper challenge
- Will make you think about the actual game mechanics like: Party Lineup / Character Powers & how they work with each other / Proper combat tactics.
  
**The Dark Urge**
- Fully evil playthrough
- Become Baahls chosen, etc.


**Shadowheart Origin - Evil**
- Playthrough as the Origin character
- Go fully down the dark path with her
- A lot of this might already be covered - or not with *The Dark Urge* playthrough
