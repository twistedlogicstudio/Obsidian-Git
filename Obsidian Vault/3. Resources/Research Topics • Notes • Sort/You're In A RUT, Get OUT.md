# SIGNS YOU'RE IN A RUT

Falling into a rut is usually a slow burn, bit-by-bit. You do you're normal day-to-day, everything seems fine, then suddenly theres no enjoyment in anything.

Here are some signs:

*Everday seems the same.*
time seems to almost bleed into itself? Days drag on forever, but at the same time, flying you by?

*You feel like you're just trying to get through another day*
Just one step infront of the other - lifes lacking inspiration & excitment

*Never feel motivated*
You might want to do things, start new projects, but for some reason just can't seem to get started

*You feel unfulfilled*
Everything seems dull & boring - you want to try new things but just don't know where to begin

*You want to change, but fear discomfort*
You know that change is really what you need, especially in the long run, but you don't break free of the mould because it means you don't have to risk failure or pain

# REASONS YOU MIGHT FEEL STUCK IN A RUT

Lots of different things can contribute to feelings of `Rutness`
be it health, friendships, work, relationships, etc.

It's important not to criticise or berate yourself once further understanding of the root cause. But also don't try to `minimise` the issue. `Minimising` the issue can be counterproductive.

Even if things might feel *just fine* - if you're not satisfied...

**It's time to make a change.**

## Personal Thoughts
I think that i'm feeling stuck & in a rut because of:

* `Health` ~ this is the unhealthiest i've been in a *VERY* long time, the fattest i've been, the laziest and most unmotivated.

* `Career` ~ the main one I think is to do with career path. I was so unhappy to slog away endlessly working behind the bar. So once I finally ballsed up to quit - I haven't really done much to further the career I want
 
 - A lot of busy work, but not too much actual productivity & progress
  
* `Personal Relationships` ~ In the last couple of years I've definitely let my friends slip away, with my inatentiveness, as well as not paying enough love & attention to these relationships

* `Finances` ~ this is for sure the one that is causing me the most stress in my life currently, which I think bleeds into all other aspects of my life... HARD.
 
 - I need to re-work my relationship with money, and make it a strong focus in paying off the debts that I owe.
