You should honour yourself, your work (present & future) by committing to your system for at least the next 30 days.

You’re not going to be able to capture everything, organise it perfectly ect, in the next month. The main goal is to do 10% better at what you’re currently doing already.

> *It’s better to make less progress with the wrong app for the next 30 days, than to make no progress at all, continuously switching platforms & restructuring your systems.*

## Step 1. Your Inputs
You need to first identify the most important inputs that already exist in your life. There’s a lot of different inputs you have in your life, some examples can be:

- Social Media
- Podcasts
- Videos
- Books / Articles
- Conversations & Thoughts

Firstly we need to start off by categorising these inputs. Start off with a new note.

### Link new note here

Write down your **top inputs** in life where you *receive the most inbound information, on a daily basis.*

Now rate each of these inputs on 2 things:
- Value - Low / Medium / High
- Volume - Low / Medium / High

If you’re not too sure on how much volume an input is, a good way you can gauge is to just leave a note open for a day or 2, & each time you receive an input, notice where it came from (a conversation, reading, watching, etc.) and write it down right into the note.


> [!NOTE] ### What does this tell us?
> *This tells us that some of the inputs in our lives have more inherent value than others*

- If you’re an academic, probably have countless PDF’s & articles to read through
- If you’re a first time parent there’s probably more books to read than what you can keep count of
- If you’re trying to get better at cooking, more than likely there’s too many articles & recipes around than what you can track yourself

We have to consciously prioritise the note-taking that we do, because we ***cannot*** capture it all. We just want to capture & get **10% more** from the information that’s already passing through our lives.

## Step 2. Capture What Resonates
