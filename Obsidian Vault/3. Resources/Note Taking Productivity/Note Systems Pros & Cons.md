This is going to be used for me to help figure out whats the best system to stick to & use.

## Ideas & Thoughts
Maybe you could use both? This idea needs to be properly thought out - covering everything from:
- Why: you should use both
- How: everything will be integrated into each other

Even just messing about moving some notes over to Obsidian I can see that Apple Notes is a good way definitely in collaboration, as well as for the mobile versions it's way better for things like tables & maybe even check lists.

Maybe a good way to do things for now - Go through and fully sort your Apple Notes into the proper PARA method - once thats done, maybe try moving some things over and seeing if that can help you to decide.

# Apple Notes
## Pros
- Simple & easy to use - don't end up wasting a lot of time trying to configure & customising things
- Functionality across all devices is the best using this
- Integration with certain things is way better - Apple Apps like Reminders, Calendar, Freeform, etc.
- The Quick Notes function is the best & easiest with this - across all devices
- Rich notes is easiest & best here
- Linking pages is easiest here - Link page button
- Hand writing is best using this - Apple Pencil
- Best drawing experience
- IT'S FREE
- Collaboration is best using this compared to Obsidian - sharing notes with Apple users is super easy - they can also add in their own work right into the note itself
- Can be easily accessed through icloud.com on any platform
- Tables are way easier to use in Apple Notes - especially for mobile versions

## Cons
- Does not have Markdown - does but have to pay for external app & only for Mac - Pro Notes
- UI is annoying somehow
- No idea about the features they plan on implementing in the future

# Obsidian
## Pros
- Markdown based 
- App can use things like tabs & bookmarks
- Best looking across the 2 
- Fully customisable UI & interface
- Best customisability - this can also be a con - look below 
- has things like Daily Notes - good for journaling or reflection
- Has the command line tool inside any note using '/'
- Has the outline section in the side-panel / pretty much a 'contents'  section
- Has an outlined list of things they plan to bring into Obsidian for the future

## Cons
- Sync is paid - might be able to find something else that isn't paid - Sync Things
- No Proper way to collaborate with others
- Fully customisable - can end up wasting a lot of time customising shit
